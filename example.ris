AB  - Background: Energy-efficient university campuses will play a vital role in the development of future sustainable cities, and will be important for achieving the Chinese carbon-neutrality goals. It is, therefore, necessary to develop new decision-making tools for evaluating the sustainability of campus buildings. Since university campuses typically comprise a broad variety of building types, standardized evaluation methods and tools, such as Green BIM, are needed. Green BIM (Building Information Modeling) emphasizes the importance and role of BIM technology in the design and construction of green buildings, providing a standardized framework for the decision-making process, and methods for improving the green performance of buildings. Methods: This study develops a method based on the Green BIM framework, using BIM architecture to analyse building performance, and the Assessment Standard for Green Building (GB/T 50378-2019) standard to establish benchmark values for evaluation, and project objectives. The method is evaluated on three examples of the most representative university buildings in northern China. The goal is to understand common denominators and differences between different types of campus buildings, in terms of green building indicators, that are important to consider in the early design stages of campus building complexes. Results: In this study, a library is used as a case study to demonstrate the tools for evaluating green performance. The study optimizes green performance from five aspects: surrounding environment, function layout, envelope performance and system transformation, and management measures improvement. The results show that this optimization scheme can achieve reductions of the annual loads of about 47.4%, in line with the national energy efficiency standards for public buildings. In particular, the heating load was reduced by 59.1%, and the cooling load reduced by 21.5%. Conclusion: A comprehensive approach, combining the aspects of planning, building design, system design, energy management, and energy conservation planning, is required to improve the green performance of university buildings to meet the goals. In the future, it will be further necessary to perform data mining of energy consumption patterns, and continue energy retrofitting of existing buildings and energy systems, to achieve the goal of green and low-carbon campuses. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - The European Union (EU) has developed policies aimed at accelerating the retrofit of existing buildings, with the vision of a decarbonised building stock by 2050. Retrofitting of existing buildings offers significant opportunities to reduce global energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. Although there is a wide range of government incentives available, retrofits only affect 0.5–1% of the building stock per year. Thus, this research conducted a literature review in order to identify the barriers preventing retrofitting of existing buildings. These barriers include low financial availability, user awareness, uncertainty in regulatory frameworks and fragmentation of the supply chain. The research presented here overcomes these retrofit barriers by developing a novel step-by-step guideline for building retrofit. The proposed workflow combines the benefits of Building Information Modelling (BIM) with the Business Process Modelling (BPM) technique. BIM is used for its capacity to create and manage information along the full life-cycle of a building. While BPM allows to optimise the retrofit workflow, by providing all relevant stakeholders with (i) the instruments to better understand their roles and responsibilities in the retrofit process, (ii) the technological framework and data needed to efficiently implement BIM within the project. This novel BIM- BPM workflow was demonstrated on a residential pilot building located in Inis Mór, Ireland. © 2022 The Authors

TI  - A Bayesian approach with urban-scale energy model to calibrate building energy consumption for space heating: A case study of application in Beijing

AB  - Urban-scale energy model can be a crucial tool for evaluating and in turn propelling the implementation of energy efficiency and low carbon programs for buildings and cites. A variety of disputes on integrity and correctness lie in basic statistical data of China's building energy use. Inadequate information and performance gap caused by input uncertainties are the common obstacles to produce reliable energy modelling results. This paper develops a bottom-up approach to depict energy use intensity (EUI) for space heating of building in the urban level accurately, even if the data resource is inadequate and imprecise or the data are influenced by uncertain issues. A hybrid probability model is developed and the model parameters are calibrated by Bayesian inference and Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulation using data set of meter reading from 2062 stochastic-sampled heating substations in Beijing. Preparation and simulation efforts of using this energy model are discussed, following this framework and adjusting according to local climate conditions, typological building characteristics and morphological urban-scale parameters. The results show that the approach is reliable and efficient to calibrate parameters in building energy models. The urban-scale benchmarks of EUI for space heating in Beijing is successfully performed to demonstrate the proposed methodology. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - A retrofit plan for improving the energy efficiency of an existing building can contribute to a sustainable built environment. This study presents a novel framework for integrating mathematical optimization, 6D-Building Information Modeling (BIM), and Life Cycle Assessment to enhance existing buildings' energy efficiency through applying energy retrofit measures. This framework aims to (1) integrate life cycle cost, and environmental impacts analysis (2) identify energy-efficient alternatives for buildings' energy retrofit (3) make the decision-making process straightforward for decision-makers and investors (4) discover the primary energy efficiency agents that impose the most energy waste on existing buildings. This study contributes to the body of knowledge by applying effective retrofit measures and alternative material choice and empowers decision-making by analyzing life cycle cost and environmental impacts of building envelopes by combining mathematical optimization, BIM, and LCA. The BIM energy model compares the cooling and heating loads of the building's components before and after applying retrofitting measures. The results show that inefficient buildings' envelopes and evaporative coolers play a significant role in energy consumption. A developed mathematical optimization model estimates the economic benefits of energy efficiency upgrades to minimize the total lifecycle cost of a building during its lifetime. Moreover, it provides an optimum energy retrofitting scenario that leads to reductions of 24%–58.2% in energy consumption. In conclusion, the Life Cycle Assessment Comparison between the building before and after retrofitted measures demonstrates that over 45% of global warming impacts could be reduced in the well-established building. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The building industry consumes the most energy globally, making it a priority in energy efficiency initiatives. Heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems create the heart of buildings. Stable air handling unit (AHU) functioning is vital to ensuring high efficiency and extending the life of HVAC systems. This research proposes a Digital Twin predictive maintenance framework of AHU to overcome the limitations of facility maintenance management (FMM) systems now in use in buildings. Digital Twin technology, which is still at an initial stage in the facility management industry, use Building Information Modeling (BIM), Internet of things (IoT) and semantic technologies to create a better maintenance strategy for building facilities. Three modules are implemented to perform a predictive maintenance framework: operating fault detection in AHU based on the APAR (Air Handling Unit Performance Assessment Rules) method, condition prediction using machine learning techniques, and maintenance planning. Furthermore, the proposed framework was tested in a real-world case study with data between August 2019 and October 2021 for an educational building in Norway to validate that the method was feasible. Inspection information and previous maintenance records are also obtained through the FM system. The results demonstrate that the continually updated data combined with APAR and machine learning algorithms can detect faults and predict the future state of Air Handling Unit (AHU) components, which may assist in maintenance scheduling. Removing the detected operating faults resulted in annual energy savings of several thousand dollars due to eliminating the identified operating faults. © 2022 The Author(s)

AB  - To achieve carbon neutrality, the South Korean government has been retrofitting existing buildings to reduce their energy consumption. However, existing buildings often lack sufficient information for building energy modeling. In this study, a model was developed for predicting heating energy demand using only information obtained from a preliminary survey. Three different models were considered: multiple linear regression (MLR), artificial neural network (ANN), and support vector regression (SVR). They were then trained with data on old houses of low-income households in South Korea and were used to predict the heating energy demand of individual household units. Different input variables were applied to the initial models to identify target variables and tune the hyperparameters. In tests, ANN was slightly more accurate than SVR. SVR required a shorter total running time (training and prediction), but ANN was 10 times faster than SVR when only prediction was considered. Therefore, ANN was selected. The selected model method takes 0.215 s for 10,000 cases. On the other hand, the previous method takes approximately an hour for one case except time for moving to a field. This shows the suggested method is much faster than the previous one. The proposed model was applied to a case study, and the predicted and true values had a relative error of only 1.40%. The proposed model can be used to predict the heating energy demand of old houses while requiring only the heating area and construction year as inputs. © 2022

AB  - Multi-layer-perceptron-feedforward neural-networks (MLPFFNNs) are proposed to monitor electricity consumption of generic telecommunication sites, thus addressing well-known energy saving and environmental issues. The proposed prediction tool helps infer telecommunication site efficiency, thus enabling undertaking suitable energy intelligence actions (monitoring, control and diagnosis, supervision) as a function of a large number of data and information. A trial-and-error analysis was performed to find the most accurate neural network for such a prediction task. Physical knowledge and intrinsic behavioral features of telecommunication sites indicated that 2 electricity consumptions- and 4 weather-related variables shall populate the input layer. The number of hidden neurons, along with training and test splitting percentages, were selected as the variables to refine within the networks development task. Statistical assessment of accuracy was conducted via joint evaluation of root mean square error and coefficient of determination. The precision and generalization of the best MLPFFNN were successfully assessed on a relevant sites dataset. Prediction percentage errors set to 5.65% and 5.77% for monthly and weekly assessment, respectively, thus confirming the suitability of the proposed modelling approach to meet regulatory standards (i.e., ISO 50001), requiring reliable and continuous monitoring and diagnosis of large fleets of industrial buildings, such as central offices and datacenters. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Creating glazed facades performance map based on energy and thermal comfort perspective for office building design strategies in Asian hot-humid climate zone
PY  - 2022
AU  - Hwang, R.-L.
AU  - Chen, W.-A.
AB  - Glazed facades are broadly applied in modern architecture especially office buildings. However, glass enables massive heat transmitted into buildings that leads to thermal discomfort and energy profligacy particularly in hot-humid climate zone. Considering the strategies of energy use and thermal comfort at initial design process is beneficial for building performance, while there is shortage of approachable method to easily involve in building energy modeling or thermal comfort assessment. To enhance the connection of architecture design and building environment, this study proposed a guide map to provide visualized information from the aspects of energy use and thermal comfort through simulating the performance of different composition of glazed facade parameters. Specifically, cases with various facade configurations located in Southeast Asia cities are set to demonstrate the cooling load and long-term thermal comfort evaluation, including Environmental Quality Index (EQI), Spatial Thermal Comfort Availability (sTCA), and Temporal Thermal Comfort Usability (tTCU). Furthermore, a comprehensive thermal parameter called facade solar aperture is suggested to describe the performance of solar gains from facade; eventually, correlation among facade parameters, energy use, thermal comfort, and geographic location is disclosed. The results also indicated that to eliminate the discomfort for maintaining the condition of PMV = 0.5, the setting temperature of air-conditioning needs to be decreased by 2 °C ∼ 3 °C which corresponding to the increasing cooling load of 142.5 MJ/m2 to 215.0 MJ/m2. Comprehensively, through the proposed method, architects can obtain optimal schemes of different parameters, then balance the energy conservation and thermal comfort through better glazed facade design strategies. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Existing building commissioning (EBCx) is a promising approach to save energy and improve indoor environmental quality (IEQ) without sufficient attention yet. However, the uncertainty of building performance post-retrofit leads to a low adoption rate of EBCx, as the commissioning outcomes are dependent on various factors and difficult to model. To facilitate decision-making on EBCx, this paper introduces PECCO, a parametric mathematical model enriched with years of commissioning engineering experience to predict comprehensive EBCx outcomes for various types of public buildings, along with a mobile-based tool to automate the prediction process. An 8-min questionnaire is used to collect building parameters regarding general, management, HVAC, smart system, IEQ, electrical, water supply, and building envelope. Then, a mathematical model predicts commissioning outcomes including energy-saving potential, annual cost saving, asset value increase, comfort-improvement potential, operation risk, commissioning cost, simple payback period, and difficulty in commissioning, and provides overall commissioning strategies, specific commissioning suggestions, and benchmark figures compared with other buildings. Three case studies suggested that PECCO's prediction on the simple payback period achieved a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 15.47%, which is acceptable and comparable to other related studies. By providing various perspectives of information to building owners and managers, PECCO is helpful to foster the industry to undertake EBCx, leading to a more energy-efficient, low-carbon building industry. © 2022

AB  - In a world where sustainability constantly manifests itself as the contemporaneous zeitgeist in practically every facade of our lives, it is imperative to understand the energy performances (EP) of buildings, both old and new, and explore innovative ways to optimise this cardinal aspect of building operation. In this light, we investigate the potential benefits of integrating Building Information Modelling (BIM) into EP analysis of built infrastructures. This research, in the form of a case study, has been designed to uncover equipments of high energy consumption in an Eco-Home, and subsequently to compare BIM-based simulations with the actual data measured on energy consumption. From the analysis, this study also proposes several recommendations on energy optimisation. For the purpose of EP analysis and simulation runs, Autodesk Green Building Studio (GBS) has been deployed, while 3D BIM Model of the Eco-Home was generated using Autodesk Revit. In situ energy audit revealed that the air-conditioner was the most energy-intensive equipment in the Eco-Home. Only a small variation of energy consumption was observed in actual and simulated data. Further analysis on design alternatives illustrated that the EP of the Eco-Home can be vastly improved by adopting a few measures, such as the installation of occupancy sensors to automate lighting, the integration of greywater reclamation system to reduce water consumption, and the addition of photovoltaic panels to increase renewable energy generation. However, from the same analysis, wind energy was found to be inviable due to its low level of energy potential. This paper concludes that integrating BIM and GBS into EP analysis not only improves the overall EP measurements, but also acts as an enabler for designers and building owners to compare design alternatives effectively. The advancement of BIM integration in this study offers an interesting proposition for the architectural, engineering, and construction industry especially when it comes to the enhancement of sustainability of a building. © 2022, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Global energy concerns necessitate designing energy-efficient buildings. Many important decisions affecting energy performance are made at early stages with little information. Dynamic simulations support informed decision-making; however, uncertainty, high computational time, and expensive modelling efforts impair their use at early stages. This article develops an approach using building information modelling and machine learning that provides quick energy performance information. This approach has been implemented into a web tool, p-energyanalysis.de. It allows design space exploration, assesses the energy performance of design options, compares multiple options, performs sensitivity analysis, and tracks changes. Twenty-one participants (researchers and architects) used it as a support tool for designing an energy-efficient building. Their feedbacks are discussed as part of the tool development. The study found that the tool supports early-stage design decisions by quickly providing relevant information. The limitations, such as the bias in the results towards training data population and implementation issues, are also discussed. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Development of a prediction model tuning method with a dual-structured optimization framework for an entire heating, ventilation and air-conditioning system
PY  - 2022
AU  - Matsuda, Y.
AU  - Ooka, R.
AB  - Heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) account for a large proportion of energy consumption. Improving the energy efficiency of HVAC and utilizing increased amounts of renewable energy are effective strategies for achieving decarbonization. While thermal storage is one of the key technologies that solves a renewable energy issue that has the temporal and geographical gaps between supply and demand, operation planning using optimization methods, such as model predictive control, is important owing to the complexity of the system. A prediction model with high accuracy and low computational load is required because the performance of model predictive control typically depends on it. Further, to facilitate its extensive use in common buildings, it is necessary to develop a simple modeling method that requires no expertise. This study proposes a framework based on a dual-structured optimization process as a modeling method to create a prediction model. This method was applied to an actual small-scale office building. It was confirmed that such a model which accurately predicts up to 24 h ahead within approximately 1 s can be created.1 © 2022

AB  - In the light of special attention of world governments to a viable and sustainable decarbonization way of the existing building stock, this article considered the feasibility of using a method of Building Information Modeling (BIM)-enabled Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) for the refurbishment in terms of environmental compatibility, energy efficiency, and profitability. An existing residential building in Nanjing was chosen as a case study. The paper investigated the environmental, energy, and economic efficiency of the case building hypothetically refurbished to the Passive House (PH) and “low energy building” (LEB) technologies. The analysis was made based on real construction and energy consumption data, monitored over three years. Also, a comparison of the environmental, energy-efficient, and economic feasibility of two hypothetical models refurbished to the PH and LEB technologies is considered. The results show that BIM-enabled LCA is a powerful tool for refurbishing existing residential buildings due to a comprehensive assessment of environmental compatibility, energy efficiency, and profitability. According to the results, special attention should be paid to reducing cooling loads, using materials with a high recycling rate and low cost, reducing the thickness of the insulation layer, using polyvinyl chloride (PVC) windows with movable sunshades, and setting horizontal and vertical greenery systems. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Cities play an essential role in energy consumption and its environmental impacts. Urban Building Energy Modeling (UBEM) can help optimize the built environment's energy efficiency and improve the design and operation of building energy systems. In order to develop UBEM, individual buildings' characteristics such as constructions, internal loads, energy systems, etc., are required. To develop a comprehensive urban building energy model requires detailed 3D urban building geometry information, comprehensive building attribute libraries and a detailed archetype selection to automatically assign parameters to the building construction and usage. Most of the already developed tools do not take full advantage of external data sources of building characteristics with different formats and integrate them into the UBEM workflow. This study introduces a workflow to automatically extract, collect, and pre-process the energy-related parameters from open-source data to enrich the UBEM using spatial joining of attributes and detailed archetype selection. Two different 3D urban models (low and high resolution) are proposed to be used for urban building energy simulation. The workflow using the high-resolution model is demonstrated by applying it to the downtown Montreal buildings as a Canadian case study. A novel method for assigning the building's attributes to the building surfaces and thermal zones is developed, which is based on a detailed and automatic archetype selection. The archetype-selected data and other required information for urban building energy demand calculation are fed into EnergyPlus by introducing a hierarchical concept. The high-resolution enriched UBEM is calibrated using monthly measured data of a reference building, which resulted in an acceptable root mean square error. The method was then applied to the whole district, and it could be shown that ventilation and infiltration rates have the highest impact on energy demand. This study shows that using high-resolution UBEM allows detailed urban building energy analysis, which helps decision-makers to better understand their built environment. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Global economic growth is leading to a higher demand for energy. Considering the declining cost of technology and rising fossil fuel prices, the application of renewable energy technologies is promising. The worldwide use of photovoltaic electricity is growing rapidly by more than 50% a year. In the urban environment, buildings are central to human activities. Therefore, to achieve sustainable urban development, buildings are of particular importance for distributed renewable energy generation. Of different types of buildings in the built environment, high-rise buildings are of particular interest because of their high potential for harvesting a considerable amount of photovoltaic (PV) energy on vertical and horizontal surfaces. Nevertheless, this high potential is seldom harnessed mainly because the deployment of PV modules on high-rise buildings involves consideration of a complex interplay between various factors that affect the installation of PV modules (e.g., urban canyons, self-shadowing effect, surface-specific PV modules, etc.). This renders the design of PV modules in high-rise buildings a complex optimization problem, one that requires a generative design approach. In recent years, and with the advent and rising popularity of Building Information Modeling (BIM) concept, the apparatus for the implementation of such a comprehensive generative design approach is becoming increasingly available. However, to the best of authors’ knowledge, there are currently no frameworks for the BIM-based generative design of PV modules for high-rise buildings. To this end, the present paper made a novel contribution to the body of knowledge by presenting a BIM-based generative design framework for PV module layout design on the whole exterior of tall buildings. This allows designers to consider the complex interaction between building surface types (e.g., windows, walls, etc.), type of PV module (e.g., opaque, semi-transparent, etc.), the efficiency of different PV modules, and the financial aspect of the PV system (i.e., revenue vs. cost at different study period). The results generated by the elaborate case study demonstrated that the generative design framework is capable of offering more favourable solutions (i.e., either or both of reduced costs and increased energy revenue) compared to baseline scenarios. It is observed that, in the majority of the studied scenarios, the optimum solutions favored a more consistent orientation of the panels (i.e., consistent pan and tilt angles across all the panels). © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Simplification of building energy models is one of the most common approaches for efficiently estimating the energy performance of buildings over a whole city. In city-scale models, the abstraction of a building into an information model and the division of the model into representative thermal zones cannot be building-specific but must be generic and applicable to many buildings. Considering the limited research on the performance of such methods, in this study, a comprehensive evaluation of the most relevant assumptions on zoning configurations and levels of detail is conducted in three building energy simulation tools IDA ICE, TRNSYS, and EnergyPlus. The findings from the evaluation of zoning configuration on building level and its comparison with the measured energy performance of buildings suggest that a single-zone model of a residential building gives a very similar result to a multi-zone model with one core zone and perimeter zones for every floor of the building. For the single-zone model, IDA ICE overestimates and EnergyPlus underestimates the energy demand compared to the more complex models by approximately the same amount, but EnergyPlus is preferred due to the shorter simulation time. It is also proven that higher levels of detail in building models can increase the accuracy of the results by approximately 6% annually. When extending the scope of the study from building level to district level analysis where a somewhat lesser degree of accuracy can be allowed on the individual building, the simplified models give acceptable results. © 2022 The Authors

AB  - The growing cloud computing infrastructures increase the demand for energy-intensive machines, such as high-performance servers and the associated cooling system. That brings challenges to the energy management of the concerned modern buildings such as the data centers. Transient Thermal System Modeling (TTSM) is an essential solution to illustrate the instant thermal variation inside the buildings based on heat transformation prediction. TTSM can help plan, organize and optimize corresponding settings to improve energy efficiency. The adoption of row-based and rack-based structures as a cooling solution has recently emerged, especially boosted by its high efficiency. In contrast, few studies have concerned the related TTSM. In this study, we propose two frameworks exclusively targeting the TTSM of data centers that adopted row-based or rack-based cooling systems. A model-driven framework (MDF) and a data-driven framework (DDF) are developed, respectively. The MDF is expressed by Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs), it is built based on the lumped-capacitance method under several pre-declared assumptions as a general TTSM solution to related structures. The DDF is developed as an extension of the Long-Short-Term-Memory (LSTM) method to realize multivariate I/O (MIMO) predictions, which is commonly demanded in Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) applications. Both frameworks are evaluated experimentally on a physical cluster equipped with a high-level IIoT sensor measurement system. The guide for parameter-tuning of the model is also provided in the experiment part for use case analysing. The validation results show that both frameworks can build reliable TTSM in terms of real-time temperature predictions. Moreover, a comprehensive comparison study is conducted with valuable application suggestions based on experimental discoveries. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Energy efficient Building Digital Twins (BDTs) are researched using Building Information Model (BIM) to explore the key techniques of Digital Twins (DTs). DTs in buildings can be regarded as an expression of “BIM+,” born to digital descriptions. Comprehensive perception of physical systems is the preconditions for DTs implementation. BIM's energy-saving design includes the selection of building orientation and building shape. BIM energy consumption analysis can compare different materials, examine the performance of various materials, and select the most suitable and most energy-efficient materials for building structure maintenance. Data Fusion Algorithm (DFA) in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) is improved. A novel DFA is constructed by combining Backpropagation Neural Network (BPNN) with Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DCHP), recorded as BP-DCHP. Simulation experiment proves that BP-DCHP can prolong sensor nodes’ survival time and provide the highest data fusion quality. BP-DCHP runs for about 310 s, 500 s, and 705 s in WSNs consisting of 20, 50, and 100 WSNs, respectively. Moreover, BP-DCHP can provide higher quality given insufficient data fusion degree. Once the WSNs consume 50% of the total initial energy, BP-DCHP presents a shorter network delay, only 0.6 s on average in the 100-sensor-node-WSN. To validate BDTs’ effectiveness, the environmental satisfaction of residents from two Beijing intelligent communities is assessed using Deep Learning (DL) approach. Taking the data as the clue, the study establishes DTs serving the application of urban scene, which plays a certain role in promoting the technological innovation of BDTs, better optimizing the city and managing the city. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The research fields in the fields of information science and computer are very extensive, and there are many research hotspots. Intelligent optimization algorithm is one of the research hotspots. One of the key issues found in research papers in this field is how to effectively improve the search quality of intelligent optimization algorithms in a complex work environment. As a multi-functional swarm algorithm, particle swarm optimization has relatively few parameters, good convergence, and relatively fast working speed. It is a popular intelligent algorithm. In the process of studying the optimal operation of the combined cooling, heating and power system, in order to better dispatch the output of each device in the combined cooling, heating and power system, a combination of chaotic search based on Tent mapping and nonlinear adaptive particle swarm optimization is proposed Optimization algorithm. Taking the operating cost, pollutant emission and energy efficiency of the cogeneration system as the goals, a multi-objective optimization model was established. The simulation results show that the proposed cooling, heating and power cogeneration system optimization method can effectively improve economic benefits, reduce pollution emissions, and improve energy utilization. The traditional model cannot accurately analyze the environmental pollution mitigation effect. In order to avoid this problem, a modeling analysis of the impact of wind power photovoltaic clean energy on the mitigation of environmental pollution is proposed, thereby building a wind power photovoltaic clean energy organization structure and maintaining the application of wind power photovoltaic clean energy the stability of the range. Set wind power photovoltaic clean energy to alleviate environmental pollution factors, and determine the degree of environmental pollution limited by natural numbers under continuous use of polynomial constraints. © 2021

AB  - Objective: The conception of digital twin has attracted tremendous attention and developed rapidly in the fields of smart cities, smart transportation, urban planning, and virtual/augmented reality during past years. The basic objective is to visualize, analyze, simulate, and optimize real world scenes by projecting physical objects onto digital 3D models. To apply digital twin technology successfully to downstream applications such as real-time rendering, human-scene interaction, and numerical simulation, the reconstructed 3D models should preferably be geometrically accurate, vectorized, highly simplified, free of self-intersection, and watertight. To satisfy these requirements, a potential solution called structured reconstruction method extracts geometric planes from discrete point clouds or original triangular mesh and splices them into a compact parametric 3D model. Previous methods address this problem by detecting geometric shapes and then assembling them into a polygonal mesh, but these methods usually suffer from two obstacles. First, traditional shape detection methods such as region growing algorithm rely on iteratively propagating geometric constraints around selected seeds. This greedy strategy only considers local properties and cannot guarantee the quality of global configuration. Second, current shape assembly methods typically recover the surface model by slicing the 3D space into polyhedral cells and assigning inside-outside labels to each cell. Most of these slicing-based methods preserve a high computational complexity and can hardly process more than 100 shapes. In this paper, a novel automatic approach that generates concise polygonal meshes from point clouds or raw triangular meshes in an efficient, robust manner relying upon three ingredients is proposed. Method Our method consists of three steps: shape detection, space partition, and surface extraction. Our algorithm requires as input a point cloud with oriented normal or triangle mesh. The resulting model is guaranteed to be intersection-free and watertight. First, a multi-source region growing algorithm that detects planar shapes from input 3D data through a global way is proposed. This strategy ensures that points or triangular facets located near the boundary of two shapes can be correctly clustered into their corresponding group. Next, the detected planar shapes are used to partition the bounding box of the object into a polyhedral. To avoid the computational burden involved in the shape assembling step, the partition is performed in a hierarchical manner, that is, the 3D space is recursively divided to build a binary space partitioning (BSP) tree. Starting from the initial bounding box, the largest planar shapes are used to divide a polyhedron cell into two. The planar shapes in the polyhedron are also assigned to the new polyhedron cell. If a shape spans the two polyhedrons, it is divided into two to ensure that every shape in the new polyhedron does not exceed its scope. This operation continues until no divisible polyhedron cell remains. It is equivalent to building a BSP tree. Each leaf node of the BSP tree corresponds to a convex polyhedron cell, and all leaf nodes are combined into the initial bounding box. In such a way, a detected shape only partitions the space locally, without causing redundant partitioning. Hierarchical space partition is the key to reducing the search space and improving the overall pipeline efficiency. Finally, the surface is extracted from the hierarchical partition by labeling each polyhedron as inside or outside the reconstructed model. A ray-shooting-based Markov energy function is defined, and a min-cut is operated to find inside-outside labeling that minimizes the energy function. The output surface is defined as the interface facets between the inside and the outside polyhedral. Result The robustness and the performance of our method are demonstrated on a variety of man-made objects and even large-scale scenes from three aspects of fidelity, complexity, and running time. A large number of experimental results prove that our algorithm can process objects composed of tens of thousands of planar shapes on a standard computer without a parallelization scheme. Compared with traditional slicing methods, the number of polyhedral cells obtained through this simple, robust mechanism and the running time are reduced by at least two orders of magnitude. Approximately 70% of the calculation time is used for space partition, but the total time can be controlled within 5 s/10 000 points. In addition, the root-mean-square(RMS) error of the simplified model is mostly controlled within 1%, and the simplification ratio of the facets is controlled within 1.5%. The proposed method greatly improves the calculation efficiency and accuracy of the results, and provides a good trade-off between complexity and fidelity. Conclusion: Our structural mesh reconstruction pipeline consists of three steps: shape detection, space partition, and surface extraction. Our method is especially suitable for models with rich structural features. The resulting model is guaranteed to be watertight and free of self-intersection while preserving the features of the structure. The limitation of this algorithm is that reconstruction quality mainly depends on the result of shape detection, which only considers the individual model and does not take advantage of the statistical information of the whole dataset. In addition, this algorithm is only for reconstructing watertight models. When the input data have a large area of missing parts (such as the bottom of the building data), the algorithm relies on the bounding box to close the surface. In the future, data-driven methods will be explored to improve shape detection and take advantage of the hierarchical partition for levels of detail (LOD) reconstruction. © 2022, Editorial Office of Journal of Image and Graphics.

AB  - In this study, state-of-the art deep neural networks to train and predict the heat transfer in building structures were proposed. Today, many of studies analyze thermal energy performance of buildings by analytical or numerical methods. Although building energy performance can be predicted effectively by finite element method, it is still time-consuming to calculate and solve the heat transfer problem. Moreover, expert engineer is required and complicate process to set simulation model is essential. In this work, a novel deep-learning method, which was pre-trained by the thermal simulation data, was developed to predict the thermal behavior of building structures in a fast time without complicated process. Heat transfer simulations of the slab wall building structure depending on its thermal properties and geometries were carried out to get training datasets for deep learning. The database of thermal simulation results was used for deep learning training. The image of temperature and heat flow distribution was trained by convolutional encoding–decoding network and the value of total heat loss through building and thermal bridge coefficient was trained by multi-layer perceptron. After train completed, the thermal behavior could be predicted in a second by just feeding information such as blueprint image and thermal properties of constructions into deep-learning architecture. There was no need to set a new simulation model at each time which consumes time and effort for modeling, meshing and calculating. With the developed network, the prediction of thermal behavior with high accuracy was possible in a super-fast time. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Energy conservation measures can not only improve energy efficiency; it can also enhance microgrid resilience. This paper aims at investigating energy conservation in a small microgrid, using a new hospital in Riyadh city as a case study, to satisfy the Saudi Building Code (SBC part 601) requirement of energy conservation as the first case. The second case study aims to apply and simulate additional advanced energy conservation requirements. The new hospital has considered energy conservation measures uch as upgraded Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC), lighting type effect, thermal insulation, and window material. These energy conservation considerations made a difference in the annual energy saving and efficiency of its microgrid. This study used Autodesk Revit software to obtain building information modeling (BIM) and eQUEST to perform energy simulations. The two software programs are integrated together to perform comprehensive energy simulations with detailed building information from the model by Autodesk Green Building Studio (GBS). The energy conservation measures mainly focused on energy management and saving in the building’s electrical installations. All utilized equipment in the hospital should follow the Saudi standards issued by the national authorities. The simulation results revealed a noticeable annual energy saving of up to 19.82% for the second case, using a great thermal resistance building envelope, energy-saving lighting system, and highly rated Energy Efficiency Ratio (EER) HVAC system compared to the first case. More than 100,000 SR in yearly energy saving was achieved by implementing the second case study. Applying the Value Methodology (VM) to the proposed hospital in this study saved more than 700,000 SR in the initial cost of the hospital. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Renewable energy sources based on solar and wind energy provide clean and efficient energy. The intermittent behaviour of these sources is challenging. At the same time, the needs for efficient, continuous and clean energy sources are increased for serving both electricity and thermal demands for residential buildings. Consequently, complimentary systems are essential in order to ensure a continuous power generation. One of the promising energy sources that helps in reducing CO2 emissions, in addition to providing electrical and thermal energy efficiently, is a Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC) system operated in a combined heat and power (CHP) mode, due to high electrical efficiencies (in full and part load) and the fuel flexibility. Currently, most studies tend to focus on fuel cell model details with basic information about the building’s energy requirements. Nevertheless, a deep understanding of integrating fuel cell micro-CHP systems with renewable energy systems for the residential sector is required. Moreover, it is important to define an operating strategy for the system with a specific controlling method. This helps in evaluating the performance and the efficiency of the building energy system. In this study, an investigation of different configurations of a hybrid power system (HPS) was carried out. The intended aim of this investigation was to optimize a HPS with minimal CO2 emissions, serving the energy demands for a single-family house efficiently and continuously. As a result of this study, a photovoltaic (PV)/SOFC micro-CHP system has satisfied the intended goal, where the CO2 emissions are significantly reduced by 88.6% compared to conventional systems. The SOFC micro-CHP plant operated as a complimentary back-up generator that serves the energy demands during the absence of the solar energy. Integrating the Power to Gas (PtG) technology leads to a similar emission reduction, while the PtG plant provided a seasonal energy storage. The excess energy produced during summer by the PV system is stored in the fuel storage for a later use (during winter). This SOFC micro-CHP configuration is recommended from an energy and environmental perspective. In terms of feasibility, the costs of SOFC based micro-CHP systems are significantly higher than traditional technologies. However, further technology developments and the effect of economy of scale may cause a substantial drop in costs and the micro-CHP shall become economically competitive and available for residential users; thus, enabling a self-sufficient and efficient energy production on site. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - This paper demonstrates the investigation of the acquired outcomes from consistent information observing a 467.2 kWp solar photovoltaic (SPV) framework commissioned on the roofs of three separate high-rise buildings, which are located at the location of 26.9585◦ N and 80.9992◦ E. Onside real-time performance for this system was investigated for three years, 2018–2020; this system contains 1460 SPV panels of 320 Wp each, having 20 PV panels per string, 09 DC/AC power conditioning units (PCU), and a SCADA (supervisory control and data acquisition) system for monitoring the other necessary parts of a grid-interactive SPV system. The outcomes of the different buildings are compared with each other to analyze the power output at the same input conditions. Hardware components of the plants with approximately the same ratings (P2 ~ 108.8 kWp + P3 ~ 128 kWp) are compared (with P1 ~ 230.4 kWp). Simulation modeling of the year 2020 in PVsyst tool for generated energy, Performance Ratio (PR), and Capacity Utilization Factor (CUF) are carried out additionally and compared with the installed rooftop grid-interactive SPV system of 467.2 kWp (~P1 + P2 + P3) at the site. Numerous performance parameters such as array efficiency, inverter efficiency, system efficiency, Performance Ratio (PR), and Capacity Utilization Factor (CUF) of the plant are evaluated and compared with already installed systems in different regions of the world. These points demonstrate great feedback to framework architects, workers, designers, and energy suppliers regarding the genuine limit and plausibility of the framework they can offer to clients. Moreover, one of the environmental benefits of the SPV plant is that the 467.2 kWp PV framework reduces the tremendous measure of CO2, SO2, and NOX that is discharged into the air. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Outstanding properties and advanced functionalities of thermal–regulatory by origami-based architecture materials have been shown at various scales. However, in order to model and manage its programmable mechanical properties by Building Information Modelling (BIM) for use in a covering structure is not a simple task. The aim of this study was to model an element that forms a dynamic shell that prevents or allows the perpendicular incidence of the sun into the infrastructure. Parametric modelling of such complex structures was performed by Grasshopper and Rhinoceros 3D and were rendered by using the V-ray’s plugin. The elements followed the principles of origami to readjust its geometry considering the sun position, changing the shadow in real time depending on the momentary interest. The results of the project show that quadrangular was the most suitable Origami shape for façade elements. In addition, a BIM-based automated system capable of modifying façade elements considering the sun position was performed. The significance of this research relies on the first implementation and design of an Origami constructive element using BIM methodology, showing its viability and opening outstanding future research lines in terms of sustainability and energy efficiency. © 2022 by the authors.

TI  - Machine assistance in energy-efficient building design: A predictive framework toward dynamic interaction with human decision-making under uncertainty
PY  - 2022
AU  - Chen, X.

AB  - At the energy-efficient buildings design stage, architects suffer from multi-discipline requirements and insufficient information to make proper decisions during the process. Inspired by the human nervous system's estimation mechanism, we proposed a data-driven process-based framework for decision-making support. This framework achieves the performance-oriented decision aid under uncertainties based on a general component design, consisting of three parts: the probabilistic surrogate modeling, ensemble modeling, and the model interpretation method. With the characterization of uncertainties into aleatory or epistemic based on the possibility for minimization, the component's design enables the framework to achieve dynamic interaction with users and inference toward higher intelligence to “make assumptions” in potential design space. Subsequently, it maps possible consequences of output scenarios to input variants’ causes by generating informative feedback and ensures a robust prediction under certain flexibility of incomplete inputs. We utilized the framework as an assistance system to conduct the strategic feedback of energy efficiency for building designers in different early design stages: The framework is tested on the Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) data from England and Wales (19,725,379 buildings). The result achieves a comparable forecasting performance as the SOTA machine learning and provides coherent input variants' interpretation. More importantly, during the design process, the framework enables to interactively provide building designers with expected building energy efficiency range in on-going possible design space with intervention consequences and input causes interpretation. Eventually, it drives users to operate toward higher energy-efficient building designs. © 2021

AB  - Addressing the gap between available urban building data, energy performance evaluation, and spatial distribution of end-users is a growing concern of municipalities to support energy planning and urban retrofitting towards low carbon emission. These days, many existing urban building energy models (UBEM) use the non-geo-specified 3D building stock geometries or the digital twins of cities as their primary input for energy simulation. The digital twins of cities or the built environment is an accurate scale virtual representation (geo-specified geometry and information) of city objects enabled to be paired with dynamic predictive models of their energy performance. The use of built environment digital twins for their energy assessment works well for those cities whose digital twin datasets are readily available for public or private use. In the cities without digital twin datasets, their energy assessment is limited by tools that use 2D building stock footprints as their primary input or apply a top-down urban energy simulation approach. This gap motivated the current research to identify an extended UBEM data preparation workflow focused on generating city digital twins using accessible GIS datasets as well as national and local data sources. The workflow is majorly developed to deal with GIS data processing utilizing multilevel spatial data integration and refinement to fill in the recognized inconsistencies of building databases. Then, procedural 3D city modelling and an automated transformation to a semantic, CityGML format are successfully provided to generate digital twin of the study area in an open data model. The archetype modelling method is also employed to create a set of customized housing energy profiles to support tailored bottom-up UBEM and retrofitting scenarios relying on the simulation platform Insel4Cities, under development at Concordia University. The workflow was practically carried out on a case study, Kelowna city in British Columbia (BC)/Canada, to validate the district heating load. The average simulated heating energy use intensity showed a deviation of less than 2.5% from the BC measured data. As an example of workflow usability, the developed model was also utilized to assess a retrofit scenario, combining a decentralized heat pump and photovoltaic system, to present the district's potential for net-zero action planning. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Estimating unknown parameters of a building stock using a stochastic-deterministic-coupled approach

AB  - Interest in urban building energy modeling as a tool to evaluate effective management of urban building energy and carbon reduction policies is increasing. Since it takes a lot of time to model all buildings in the city with the lack of information about buildings, archetypes have been used. However, the deterministic method using archetypes does not reflect uncertainty with the disadvantage of not presenting design alternatives. To overcome such problems, we proposed an urban building energy modeling method using a stochastic-deterministic-coupled approach. In this paper, the identifiability of unknown parameters in a building stock was verified by analyzing the effect of the meta-model accuracy on the estimation of unknown parameters in the proposed urban building energy model. In addition, the possibility of using energy conservation measure analysis of the proposed model was evaluated. As a result, the posterior distribution of unknown input parameters was distorted when using the meta-model instead of the original building energy model in Bayesian calibration for building stock. However, the distorted posterior distribution could evaluate the effect of energy conservation measures within 0.71% errors. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - A significant improvement in the building stock energy efficiency is imperative to mitigate climate change. Building stock energy models (BSEMs) that employ reference building models are useful for mitigation analysis. However, most existing BSEMs developed for commercial building stock focus on limited building systems and energy conservation measures, and technology deployments are suggested based on simple vintage-driven scenarios. These approaches are insufficient, particularly for regions where improvements to building insulation performances can have a modest impact. This study aims to establish a BSEM framework to overcome this issue and to validate the framework via its application to the Japanese commercial building stock. The framework develops statistical models for estimating the selection probabilities of system alternatives and utilizes them to disaggregate building stocks. A reference building model is developed for each stock segment. The results show that this approach facilitates the use of multiple technological options considering various factors that affect technological deployments, and it also helps estimate the baseline development of building stocks. Furthermore, the developed model well represents the observed distributions in energy use intensity and estimates the aggregated energy consumption of building stocks with a reasonable accuracy. The baseline development was estimated to reduce the CO2 emission by 18% by 2030 from 2013. Efficiency measures can help avoid the increase in electricity demand caused by electrifying the heat source of heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning and water heating systems. The framework could help extend the scope of BSEM application because BSEM development is not information intensive. © 2021 The Authors

AB  - Pakistan’s as developing economy is in crisis due to rising energy and water demand. This study considers the Green Building concept as it accounts for optimum use of energy and water conservation. A building information modelling approach has been used to analyze the Green Building concepts. Parameters of Green Building are defined within Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design rating system. A parametric model of the case study building was developed on the Autodesk Revit platform based on original drawings and details. The same model was then subjected to change by provision of insulation measures. The energy use intensity of both models is calculated and analyzed. The results from the study suggest that if better measures and decision are taken in design stage, there is potential to conserve energy by approx. 28% and water by approx. 32% and subsequently can produce renewable energy by approx. 15%. For the validation of model and results, a comparative study was made on two other platforms, namely, Green Building Studio and Insight. The study further suggests a payback period of approx. 2.3 years after the cost and saving analysis. This integrated approach expedites the certification process thus saving significant time and resources. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - In view of the shortcomings of the traditional architectural design mode, such as high rework rate in the construction process and lack of collaborative design and intelligent information processing, a green building energy-saving design method based on BIM technology was proposed. Based on the comparative analysis of traditional computer-aided building design and BIM green building technology, the overall scheme of energy-saving design was constructed from the aspects of green building design principle, design preparation, and design concept. This paper expounded the connotation of energy-saving design elements from the aspects of modeling software selection, envelope energy-saving design, and lighting energy-saving design. Accordingly, the characteristics and process of building energy efficiency analysis based on BIM were proposed. Finally, the energy-saving effect evaluation method of green building based on BIM was given, and an example showed that the energy-saving design method of green building based on BIM proposed in this paper had good feasibility and effectiveness. The method proposed in this paper can provide a certain theoretical basis and application support for the application of BIM technology in the field of green building.

AB  - Although computer technologies have greatly advanced in recent years and help engineers improve work efficiency, the heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) design process is still very time-consuming. In this paper, we propose a conceptual framework for automating the entire design process to replace current human-based HVAC design procedures. This framework includes the following automated processes: building information modeling (BIM) simplification, building energy modeling (BEM) generation & load calculation, HVAC system topology generation & equipment sizing, and system diagram generation. In this study, we analyze the importance of each process and possible ways to implement them using software. Then, we use a case study to test the automated design procedure and illustrate the feasibility of the new automated design approach. The purpose of this study is to simplify the steps in the traditional rule-based HVAC system design process by introducing artificial intelligence (AI) technology based on the traditional computer-aided design (CAD) process. Experimental results show that the automatic processes are feasible, compared with the traditional design process can effectively shorten the design time from 23.37 working hours to nearly 1 hour, and improve the efficiency. © 2022, Tsinghua University Press.

AB  - Energy efficient is becoming a significant subject to investigate within the Architecture Engineering and Construction (AEC), as a result of the expanding heating and energy usage problem. Lack of interoperability has been identified as a hurdle to increased efficiency in the AEC. In order to fulfil the expanding demands around the world, the energy analysis must be incorporated into the building's planning section. Predicting a building's energy use and establishing an energy-saving life and style are both required. To conduct an energy study of a G+3 residential structure, the article uses Autodesk (BIM) capabilities. The goals of this project are to find BIM energy analysis into calculating a building's energy consumption, as well as to conclude the life cycle cost and energy cost over time, in same building. This study's primary focus is on roof materials and alternatives accomplished with the use of Autodesk Revit software and Green Building Studio, a cloud-based energy analysis application. © 2022 University of Kuwait.

AB  - Energy use in the building sector represents an important amount of the total energy consumption. During the past decade there is an increasing attention in energy-efficient buildings to pursue sustainable development. The present paper includes a study focused on the thermal performance of traditional residential buildings built in Albania between 16th −19th century. The indoor environmental (thermal) evaluation via computational simulation was used to analyze the thermal performance of the selected typologies and to predict the consequences of alternative thermal retrofit measures. Detailed construction activity, weather information, and occupancy patterns were applied in modelling the houses. Seven improvement scenarios were applied and examined for each housing typology located in different climatic zones. The scenarios incorporate the use of thermal insulation of the walls and the roofs, as well as the use of different U-values of the glazing. The simulation results indicate that by retrofitting the building fabric, the buildings’ energy performance could be improved up to 46.3% and thermal comfort up to 7.2 °C, while requiring a payback period of 7.9 years. The performed simulation results generate an integral framework towards retrofitting of historical and traditional buildings, especially in the Mediterranean climate. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Building Information Modelling (BIM) has been effectively utilized for energy modelling and analysis widely in the design phase for complex infrastructure projects. This paper aims to identify and analyse the embodied and operational energy demand of an elevated metro rail station of Ahmedabad, India, with respect to alternate designs and building materials. The total amount of energy consumption of the elevated metro rail station in Ahmedabad, India, and its annual sun path, shadow, and wind analysis have been computed. Evaluation of the alternative building materials and designs to obtain the best in class energy requirements by using Revit architecture 2018 and green building studio has been carried out. The findings suggest a different set of building materials and sustainable designs leading to the reduction in embodied and operational energy consumption through its entire annual life cycle. The observed average embodied energy savings achieved is about 73% by the suggested alternative materials instead of existing ones. Application of factor comparison method (FCM), which is a multi-criteria decision method (MCDM) technique, has been observed that polished Kota stone flooring, stone floor tile cladding, toughened fibreglass ceiling and insulated fibreglass door appear to be the most feasible sustainable material for flooring, wall cladding, ceiling and openings and fenestrations for the design of the metro rail station box of Ahmedabad. This study contributes to the existing body of knowledge by highlighting the application of BIM as a tool for sustainable development and recommends a few alternate building materials and sustainable designs which would result in the reduction of energy usage for the metro rail station leading to a sustainable future. © 2021, The Institution of Engineers (India).

AB  - Sensor devices are becoming omnipresent, supplying data to a wide range of applications. In the building sector, sensors along with other information sources provide the basis for smart building functionalities. Predicting energy loads and inferring occupancy status of spaces are important tasks that promote energy efficiency and user comfort in buildings. For them, as for many other smart building applications, machine learning modelling utilizing sensor data is commonly applied. This article builds understanding of the environment where this kind of machine learning models have to operate by bringing up properties and quality aspects of the public building data provided by indoor sensor devices. This is done by performing a thorough case study on two real life data sets from university campus buildings located in different climates and applying very different sensor network settings. Outcomes include information about heterogeneity, correlations and temporal patterns present in sensor data, and show the need of the building field for better acknowledging the quality deficiencies that sensor data have. Our results aid in assessing and improving the quality of sensor-based indoor data utilized in machine learning modelling, in evaluating whether a data set is representative enough to build a model that is robust under changing conditions in the building, and in choosing an appropriate number of sensors per space when building an indoor wireless sensor network. © 2021 The Authors

AB  - Building energy performance evaluation, as an important process in a sustainable building design, has important consequences for global energy conservation and environmental protection. The traditional methods to perform this evaluation are usually time-consuming and computationally complex, and have high requirements for designers’ professional knowledge on architectural physics and software operation skills. To solve these problems and provide rapid, user-friendly, and more accurate prediction results, this study presents an efficient building energy performance evaluation method which integrates building information modeling, energy simulation, and energy consumption prediction together. This method follows a three-stage research framework: Stage 1 proposes a rapid 3D building energy modeling process according to the parameterized setting, Stage 2 generates numerous simulation results automatically by EnergyPlus, and Stage 3 develops the user-friendly building energy consumption prediction model with the help of the Genetic Algorithm-Neural Network (GA-NN) and provides the energy performance level of the building design after the prediction. A case study is carried out to present the overall process and verify the accuracy of the proposed three-stage building energy performance evaluation method. This study contributes to the improvement of both the extensive dataset establishment and the operational efficiency of building energy consumption prediction. It can provide designers with a real-time, user-friendly, and reliable building energy consumption prediction tool and an energy performance assessment basis in the design phase of construction projects. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Three-dimensional thermal mapping provides many benefits for auditing building energy performance when compared with two-dimensional thermal images that provide only limited representation. However, the current thermal mapping approaches have accuracy and efficiency tradeoffs when modeling large areas using aerial images. Particularly, low-resolution thermal images make it harder to obtain a high-quality thermal mapping model. To avoid using low-definition thermal images to reconstruct building thermal models and improve the performance of large-area thermal mapping, we propose a thermal and RGB data fusion framework for thermal mapping. This paper aims to evaluate how different experimental conditions on the proposed fusion approach affect the results. The evaluated conditions include different camera altitudes (60 m and 35 m), distinct camera angles (45° and 30°), diverse flight path designs (mesh grid and Y path), and various building styles (university campus buildings and buildings in a central city area). The results demonstrate that different performances of conducting the proposed data fusion approach under different conditions are observed, and the study provides suggestions for using this approach in different conditions. In addition, this study provides strategies for improving the accuracy of the proposed framework. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The characteristics of urbanism and its construction properties are critical factors in shaping energy demand and citizens' quality of life. Urban typology approaches classify the urban built environment through common patterns, facilitating building energy analysis and energy retrofitting. However, current methods struggle between detailed local building classifications and broad land spatial distributions, which include built environments. This paper presents a systematic methodology to objectively identify and classify residential urban areas according to representative Homogeneous Urban Zones (HUZs), aiming at improving the analysis of urban block energy behaviour by considering buildings and their surrounding urban conditions. Based on the characterisation of urban clusters, this methodology merges current urban classifications and defines representative urban block indicators using geographic information systems. The urban clusters are statistically delimited by testing a set of urban indicators grouped by constructive systems, morphology, and surface cover. If they successfully meet the statistical criteria of the outlier's filter, test-of-goodness-fit, and non-overlapping check, the clusters are then validated as HUZs; otherwise, they are merged, split, or rejected. Finally, the urban residential areas classified as HUZs are characterised by average, maximum, and minimum range values based on a set of representative urban indicators. This methodology was applied to the city of Madrid resulting into the definition of 10 statistically significant HUZs, grouped into four different categories. Because of the shown good adaptability of HUZs to the local urban context, it is expected that the present HUZ method represents an improvement for the standardisation of the residential building energy modelling evaluation. © The Authors

AB  - The UK Government has recently committed to achieve net zero carbon status by year 2050. Schools are responsible for around 2% of the UK's total energy consumption, and around 15% of the UK public sector's carbon emissions. A detailed analysis of the English school building stock's performance can help policymakers improve its energy efficiency and indoor environmental quality. Building stock modelling is a technique commonly used to quantify current and future energy demand or indoor environmental quality performance of large numbers of buildings at the neighbourhood, city, regional or national level. ‘Building-by-building’ stock modelling is a modelling technique whereby individual buildings within the stock are modelled and simulated, and performance results are aggregated and analysed at stock level. This paper presents the development of the Modelling Platform for Schools (MPS) – an automated generation of one-by-one thermal models of schools in England through the analysis and integration of a range of data (geometry, size, number of buildings within a school premises etc.) from multiple databases and tools (Edubase/Get Information About Schools, Property Data Survey Programme, Ordanance Survey and others). The study then presents an initial assessment and evaluation of the modelling procedure of the proposed platform. The model evaluation has shown that out of 15,245 schools for which sufficient data were available, nearly 50% can be modelled in an automated manner having a high level of confidence of similarity with the actual buildings. Visual comparison between automatically-generated models and actual buildings has shown that around 70% of the models were, indeed, geometrically accurate. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - It is known that energy efficiency passes through the renovation of the built heritage. However, the technical data may be unknown, thus applying not always suitable assumptions. Documents may have been lost and uncertainties may occur. In this context, the description of multilayer walls through equivalent models could solve the information lack issues. In this study, an experimental campaign is conducted on two test rooms, and the measured data are used to generate equivalent homogeneous walls through an inverse approach. The comparison between the original and equivalent walls is performed, finding the equivalent thermo-physical properties able to best reproduce the thermal behaviors of the original walls and calculating the model efficiency index (EF). Finally, a building simulation code is used to perform a comparison on annual energy demands. The main results allow to obtain EF indexes higher than 0.93 in almost all the analyzed scenarios. The main issue is related to the experimental equivalent thermal conductivity, the determination of which is correlated to suitable measurement conditions. Considering the energy simulations, the comparison between the equivalent models and the original ones allows to obtain a range of percentage difference of ±10 % for both energy demands and peak loads. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) system account for substantial energy use in buildings, whereas a large group of occupants is still not actually feeling comfortable staying inside. This poses the issue of developing energy-efficient HVAC control, i.e., reduce energy use (cost) while simultaneously enhancing human comfort. This brief pursues the objective and studies the stochastic optimal HVAC control subject to uncertain thermal demand (i.e., the weather and occupancy). Particularly, we involve the elaborate predicted mean vote (PMV) thermal comfort model in the optimization. The problem is computationally challenging due to the nonlinear and nonanalytical constraints imposed by the system dynamics and PMV model. We make the following contributions to address it. First, we formulate the problem as a Markov decision process (MDP) which is a desirable modeling technique capable of handling the complexities. Second, we propose a gradient-based learning (GB-L) method for progressively learning a stochastic control policy off-line and store it for on-line execution. Third, we prove the learning method's converge to the optimal policies theoretically, and its performance (i.e., energy cost, thermal comfort, and on-line computation) for HVAC control via simulations. The comparisons with the existing model predictive control based relaxation (MPC-R) method which is assumed with accurate future information and supposed to provide the near-optimal bounds show that though there exists some discount in energy cost reduction (i.e., 6.5%), the proposed method can enable efficient on-line implementation (less than 1 s) and provide a high probability of thermal comfort under uncertainties. © 1993-2012 IEEE.

AB  - Construction of multifunctional building envelopes using vertical greenery walls (VGW) has emerged as a sustainable green technology to improving cooling efficiency. To attaining the desired level of building cooling performance, VGW and overall thermal transfer value (OTTV) of the walls are useful design factors. The study aims to revise the current VGW evaluation, considering the decreased heat flux due to thermal efficiency of wall construction based on OTTV values. To achieve this, OTTV based Building Information Modelling (BIM) simulation method was proposed using Autodesk-Revit and DesignBuilder simulation based on EnergyPlus. Six wall compositions with various OTTV values of south facade for residential buildings located in sub-tropical in cooling season, were evaluated. The findings demonstrate that in the presence of a green system, a good OTTV value of the exterior walls is required for optimal performance, to keep the space within set point of cooling for long time during the cooling season. The comparisons between the bare walls and the VGW have demonstrated a great variation due to the different OTTV reached up to 6.57% and 18.44% reduction in indoor air temperature. The best combination of VGW resulted a maximum of 1.2°C reduction in indoor air temperature, with number of hours (within 28°C or less) were higher by 2506h, representing 85.59% of the overall number of hours (2928h). Overall cooling energy saving is found as 103.3kwh, representing 13.63% of the total of energy saving, and decreased the heat gained by 38.82%, representing 61.51kwh reduction during cooling season compared to base wall. © 2021 The Author(s).

TI  - CIM-based modeling and simulating technology roadmap for maintaining and managing Chinese rural traditional residential dwellings

AU  - Qian, Y.

AB  - Due to the lack of scientific construction standards and management systems, the Chinese rural traditional residential dwellings always have problems, such as low comfort level, poor safety, and large energy consumption. City Intelligent Modeling (CIM) is a three-dimensional digital city information model constructed by integrating multi-source heterogeneous data based on Building Information Modeling (BIM), Geographic Information System (GIS), Internet of Things (IoT), and other technologies. Compared with urban areas, rural residential regions have far smaller volume and simpler elements so that CIM has great feasibility in carrying out rural areas' maintenance and management. This paper introduces a CIM-based “4 M” (Modeling - Monitoring - Mining – Management) technology roadmap to build a dynamic three-dimensional visualized maintenance and management platform, which can maintain the rural traditional residential dwellings with less intervention, high efficiency, and high accuracy. This proposed platform has already been applied in a historic town in Fujian province and succeeded to early warning several potential hazards with acceptable data prediction deviation. A new concept, “Community intelligent modeling”, is put forward since this platform is not only suitable for rural traditional residential dwellings but also for other small communities. In addition, for the further optimization of rural residential regions, this simulation platform could act as a bridge between buildings and digital environment analysis software. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Photovoltaic energy generation has gained wide attention owing to its efficiency and environmental benefits. Therefore, it has become important to accurately evaluate the photovoltaic energy generation potential of building surfaces. As the number of building floors increases, the area of the facades becomes much larger than that of the roof, providing improved potential for photovoltaic equipment installation. Conventional urban solar potential evaluation methods are usually based on light detection and ranging (LiDAR). However, LiDAR can only be used in existing buildings, and the lack of semantic information in the point cloud data generated by LiDAR makes it impossible to evaluate the photovoltaic potential of facades (including details such as windows) in detail and with accuracy. In this study, we developed a method to accurately extract facades and roofs in order to evaluate photovoltaic potential based on the Industry Foundation Classes. To verify the feasibility of this approach, we used a building from Xuzhou city, Jiangsu province, China. The simulation results indicate that, out of the total building photovoltaic installable area (8995 m2 ), that of the facade is 8240 m2 . The photovoltaic potential of the simulated building could reach 1054.69 MWh/year. The sensitivity studies of the grid resolution, the time interval and the computation time confirmed the reasonability of the determined conditions. The method proposed offers great potential for energy planning departments and the improved utilization of buildings. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

TI  - Adoption of blockchain technology through digital twins in the construction industry 4.0: A PESTELS approach
PY  - 2021
AU  - Teisserenc, B.
AU  - Sepasgozar, S.
AB  - The key challenges of the building, engineering, construction, operations, and mining (BECOM) industries are the lack of trust, inefficiencies, and the fragmentation of the information value chain into vulnerable data silos throughout the lifecycle of projects. This paper aims to develop a novel conceptual model for the implementation of blockchain technology (BCT) for digital twin(s) (DT) in the BECOM industry 4.0 to improve trust, cyber security, efficiencies, information management, information sharing, and sustainability. A PESTELS approach is used to review the literature and identify the key challenges affecting BCT adoption for the BECOM industry 4.0. A review of the technical literature on BCT combined with the findings from PESTELS analysis permitted researchers to identify the key technological factors affecting BCT adoption in the industry. This allowed offering a technological framework—namely, the decentralized digital twin cycle (DDTC)—that leverages BCT to address the key technological factors and to ultimately enhance trust, security, decentralization, efficiency, traceability, and transparency of information throughout projects’ lifecycles. The study also identifies the gaps in the integration of BCT with key technologies of industry 4.0, including the internet of things (IoT), building information modeling (BIM), and DT. The framework offered addresses key technological factors and narrows key gaps around network governance, scalability, decentralization, interoperability, energy efficiency, computational requirements, and BCT integration with IoT, BIM, and DT throughout projects’ lifecycles. The model also considers the regulatory aspect and the environmental aspect, and the circular economy (CE). The theoretical framework provides key technological building blocks for industry practitioners to develop the DDTC concept further and implement it through experimental works. Finally, the paper provides an industry-specific analysis and technological approach facilitating BCT adoption through DT to address the key challenges and improve sustainability for the BECOM industry 4.0. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - A Virtual energy assessment (VEA) refers to the assessment of the energy flow in a building without physical data collection. It has been occasionally conducted before the COVID-19 pandemic to residential and commercial buildings. However, there is no established framework method for conducting this type of energy assessment. The COVID-19 pandemic has catalysed the implementation of remote energy assessments and remote facility management. In this paper, a novel framework for VEA is developed and tested on case study buildings at the University of Melbourne. The proposed method is a hybrid of top-down and bottom-up approaches: gathering the general information of the building and the historical data, in addition to investigating and modelling the electrical consumption with artificial neural network (ANN) with a projection of the future consumption. Through sensitivity analysis, the outdoor temperature was found to be the most sensitive (influential) parameter to electrical consumption. The lockdown of the buildings provided invaluable opportunities to assess electrical baseload with zero occupancies and usage of the building. Furthermore, comparison of the baseload with the consumption projection through ANN modelling accurately quantifies the energy consumption attributed to occupation and operational use, referred to as ‘operational energy’ in this paper. Differentiation and quantification of the baseload and operational energy may aid in energy conservation measures that specifically target to minimise these two distinct energy consumptions. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Recently, the application of building information modeling (BIM) in building energy efficiency design programs has been emphasized in research. In China, faced with requirements in building energy efficiency design standards and specifications, researchers have been using BIM as a platform for breaking up bottlenecks in energy simulation and design software, and BIM is considered the key to improve the efficiency of building energy efficiency design. Firstly, based on the trade-off energy consumption judgment method proposed in the 'Public Building Energy Efficiency Design Standard (GB50189-2015)', this study combines the BIM platform with an orthogonal simulation design adopting an experimental building construction project in a cold region of China, to thereby study the influences of different envelope structural parameters on cooling and heating loads. Then, this study analyzes the continuity and consistency of data exchange between different BIM-related software, through the modeling software Revit and the sustainable analysis software Ecotect. Finally, through the experiment, the critical factors of the optimized design of the building envelope are investigated and applied for the optimized design of the building thermal system. In addition, this study uses BIM to complete an energy efficiency design for a laboratory heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) system. According to the experimental results, the following conclusions can be drawn: this study proposes a BIM-based optimized design method of building thermal system, which complies with various Chinese building energy efficiency standards and polices and can be used as a reference for Chinese designers. Also, the issues and challenges in building consumption simulation based on BIM technology and the application of BIM technology in the design of building thermal HVAC systems are discussed, and the development trends of BIM technology in China are analyzed. Building thermal system and HVAC system design are the key points of building efficiency design. The optimized design method proposed in this paper is of great significance to this system design. The optimized design method can improve the design efficiency of designers while complying with China's standards and policies. Therefore, it can save costs, improve the economic benefits of the projects and, at the same time, obtain an ideal building efficiency design. © 2021 The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - The Paris Agreement requires building retrofitting practices to be more efficient and effective. However, the current practice for building energy retrofitting is lacking behind, and one reason for that is the time‐consuming process of energy credit evaluation. Energy performance assessment such as BREEAM‐NL in the Netherlands could apply a more automatic approach with the help of building information modelling (BIM) for an efficient building energy retrofitting evaluation process. However, to what extent BIM can help in accelerating energy performance evaluation in the BREEAM‐NL certification process is under‐examined. This paper first combines literature findings with practical interviews from a case study organization to present a holistic overview of the potential for automating energy‐related credits evaluation in BREEAM‐NL using BIM. To understand the possible impacts of such transition, a responsible, accountable, consulted, and informed (RACI) matrix is developed to map the impacts on different actors involved. Furthermore, to help practitioners in an organizational context to adopt a BIM‐enabled energy credits assessment workflow, the case study organization is studied to (1) understand their current BIM use status; (2) propose a suitable starting point to take toward a BIM‐enabled energy performance assessment for building energy retrofitting. Finally, the proposed starting point is demonstrated using a customized application, and the project team’s feedback is used to verify its efficiency and future directions are identified. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - The construction is increasing in the massive way everyday so the effect of it to the environment is also increasing. Construction of the structure is not adequate requires consciousness towards it. The application of the concept of sustainable construction using Building Information Modeling can be a healthier solution on earth. This paper aims to study the residential building to enhance sustainability by inducing sustainable energy concept using Auto desk Revit which includes parameters such as, carbon emission, fuel consumption, monthly heating and cooling load to meet the energy requirement for today without disturbing the environment and reusing it again. The 2D plan of the building is created using AutoCAD software. The sketch up software is used for building 3D modelling and it has been rendered to Autodesk Revit. As Revit is simple in application which includes the features for architecture, mechanical, electrical and plumbing in construction. Building information modelling (BIM) is used to model design with precision, adequate performance. The application of the BIM helps in conceptualization and analysis with substantial results which will provide benefit on Global environment, economic benefits and also human health. Using BIM the performance of the conventional building and energy building is compared. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Occupancy information is one of the crucial variables in modelling and predicting the energy use in buildings. However, the presence of occupants is often stochastic in nature. In the presented case of eight space typologies derived from three institutional building blocks, a substantial variation in the correlation between occupancy and energy consumption is found for different space types during the semester and semester breaks for various resolutions of day and time. Further, it has been identified that a weak correlation between occupants and energy use is due to the use of common plug and lighting loads such as office printers, projectors, lab instruments, and fluorescent lamps. However, in the spaces studied, such as offices and computer rooms, the control of plug and lighting loads can be at individual occupancy levels for avoiding energy wastages. To characterize occupancy and energy consumption patterns by different space types and occupant types, this study develops and presents an integrated, data-driven modelling framework and results for different space types (like classrooms, studios, computer rooms, office spaces and laboratories and time resolution (hourly to semester-long intervals) for the case study building. It is found that the Deep Neural Network (DNN) model exhibits a slightly better prediction accuracy than conventional machine learning/regression models such as gradient boosting, support-vector network, and feed-forward neural network. However, in terms of computation time, the gradient boosting model is found to be faster than the DNN model for comparable outcomes. The developed integrated model will better equip the building facility management for an occupant-oriented control of building systems for energy efficiency. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - How to make building renovation work for low-income renters: Preferences for distributional principles and procedural options in Austria
PY  - 2021
AU  - Seebauer, S.
AB  - Widespread thermal refurbishment of existing buildings is essential for mitigating carbon emissions and energy poverty. Retrofitting for better energy efficiency in low-income rental housing comes up against the tenant-landlord dilemma, however; for renovation to be accepted by residents, rules for cost sharing and fair implementation are required. The present study employs structural equation modelling to analyse distributional and procedural preferences in a survey sample of 942 social welfare recipients in Austria. The distributional principles of polluter-pays and energy bill neutrality are preferred for allocating renovation costs. Equal-pay, ability-to-pay, and paying extra instalments to finance the renovation are only accepted for buildings in high need of renovation. Low-income renters welcome a wide range of procedural options, in particular, providing transparent and comprehensive information on the planned renovation and mitigating inconvenience during the construction phase. Psychological and relational capabilities play into these preferences: households holding pro-environmental attitudes favour polluter-pays to prevent free-riders. A frugal mindset, trust in the landlord and renter concerns make low-income renters endorse ability-to-pay to avoid being displaced to lower-grade dwellings on a discriminating housing market. The results suggest that distributional principles need not stand alone but could be combined. For instance, allocating the majority of renovation costs by polluter-pays, but a smaller share by ability-to-pay, may cushion disproportionate impacts on less affluent residents. Energy counselling could empower low-income renters to manage personal energy and renovation costs, and to build literacy about renovation benefits and legal claims to encourage their landlord to renovate. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Applying the concepts of sustainability to reduce energy waste and environmental pollution in architecture has created a topic called sustainable architecture with an environmental approach. In recent years, the demand for adopting methods to promote environmental sustainability has increased. The construction industry, by introducing the Building Information Modeling (BIM) method, has provided an opportunity for professionals to achieve the goals of sustainable development more effectively. This study was carried out to investigate which attributes of BIM are of most contribution to improving the most important criteria of environmental sustainability. For this purpose, after collecting BIM attributes and environmental sustainability criteria, they were evaluated in the form of two questionnaires and the research data were analyzed through structural equation modeling (SEM) technique in Smart PLS software. The results of the study demonstrated that the BIM attributes such as virtualization of buildings, energy efficiency analysis and simulation maintenance or the retrofit process play an instrumental role in the overall promotion of environmental sustainability. Moreover, the most important criteria based on which BIM implementation can have the most impact on their improvement are in the field of materials and resources, energy and atmosphere, and innovation. © 2021 American Society of Civil Engineers.

TI  - Effective factors for residential building energy modeling using feature engineering
PY  - 2021
AU  - Mo, Y.

AB  - Given the improved understanding of sustainability, hundreds of factors are identified to have relevance to building energy efficiency. However, there is still a lack of knowledge about what factors play a significant role in energy consumption prediction for residential buildings. In the absence of this information, building energy consumption prediction would not be efficient. To tackle this problem, this study creates a feature engineering-based analytic framework to select effective factors for energy consumption prediction and assess their implications. Two application cases are reported to demonstrate the efficiency improvement of energy consumption prediction for residential buildings. The cases use the Residential Energy Consumption Survey database that contains more than 270 energy use-related factors about buildings and occupants in the United States. Data analysis from the two cases shows that selected features achieve 97–102% of prediction power while using 12–15% number of factors, largely reducing the dimensionality for energy prediction. The results also produce a list of significant features that are efficient predictors for residential energy modeling and evaluation at the national and regional levels. Examples of the selected features are the total number of rooms and full bathrooms, frequency of clothes dryer used, type of the housing unit, number of ceiling fans and television. The selected features explain energy use patterns and their relationships which help designer, contractors, and occupants better understand energy, behaviors, and the built environment. The resultant energy use patterns inform regional similarities, differences, and distinctive characteristics. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Green Building Information Modelling is a novel approach which address the momentous need of sustainability. It offers more standardized way of creating buildings which in turn optimize the building performances while attending to the sustainable requirements. Comprising numerous techniques, Green BIM ensures more accurate and comprehensive building performances to optimize the energy efficiency of buildings. Thus, there is a considerable advantage to create more energy efficient buildings using Green BIM. However, the use of Green BIM for existing green buildings is very less while new green buildings are managed using Green BIM. Hence, this research focused to assess the applicability of integrating Green Building Information Modelling for existing green buildings through a practical implementation and identifying the potential challenges. Conducting a comprehensive literature survey first, Green BIM techniques and data requirements of Green BIM were reviewed. A single case study was conducted next, to practically apply the Green BIM technology. The data requirements for Green BIM were identified prior to the selection of case for the study. A questionnaire survey was conducted to analyze the data availability including the data identified from literature. Analyzing the survey findings, an existing green building was selected and finally, the steps to be followed for the use of Green BIM were established. The challenges of the implementation were also presented in this study. The findings proved that; Green BIM is a potential technology for the existing green buildings. © 2020 WITPress.

TI  - A receptive-responsive tool for customizing occupant's thermal comfort and maximizing energy efficiency by blending BIM data with real-time information
PY  - 2021
AU  - Birgonul, Z.
AB  - Purpose: The heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems are responsible for a significant proportion of the energy consumption of the built environment, on which the occupant's pursuit of thermal comfort has a substantial impact. Regarding this concern, current software can assess and visualize the conditions. However; integration of existing technologies and real-time information could enhance the potential of the solution proposals. Therefore, the purpose of this research is to explore new possibilities of how to upgrade building information modeling (BIM) technology to be interactive; by using existing BIM data during the occupation phase. Moreover, the research discusses the potential of enhancing energy efficiency and comfort maximization together by using the existing BIM database and real-time information concomitantly. Design/methodology/approach: The platform is developed by designing and testing via prototyping method thanks to Internet of things technologies. The algorithm of the prototype uses real-time indoor thermal information and real-time weather information together with user's body temperature. Moreover, the platform processes the thermal values with specific material information from the existing BIM file. The final prototype is tested by a case study model. Findings: The outcome of the study, “Symbiotic Data Platform” is an occupant-operated tool, that has a hardware, software and unique Revit-Dynamo definition that implies to all BIM files. Originality/value: The paper explains the development of “Symbiotic Data Platform”, which presents an interactive phase for BIM, as creating a possibility to use the existing BIM database and real-time values during the occupation phase, which is operated by the occupants of the building; without requiring any prior knowledge upon any of the BIM software or IoT technology. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AU  - Shukra, Z.A.
AU  - Zhou, Y.
AB  - Purpose: Despite the construction industry's significant impact on high energy use and a growing carbon footprint, technologies like Green BIM help to optimize natural resources, reduce pollution, use sustainable space and work on human comfort and health. But the trend in a holistic approach is minimal. Thus, the paper aimed to systematically investigate Green BIM research and implementation trends using a mixed-method and also show the prospects of holistic Green BIM implementation. Design/methodology/approach: First, we conducted a Scientometrics analysis on the topic using the Scopus database for the time interval of (2013–present). Secondly, the Qualitative Content Review method asserted the Scientometrics analysis result. Lastly, exploratory research was done on secondary data to compare the AEC industry trend for a comprehensive view. Findings: The merged findings confirmed the partial implementation of Green BIM and of which 43% of research focused only on energy analysis. Despite the potential of BIM and the interrelationship among green building parameters, the result showed other aspects of green building and sustainable design parameters as green material selection, sustainable site, waste management and water-use efficiency not comprised. Originality/value: The authors propose a new conceptual framework for integrating green building parameters, BIM tools and green building assessment tools in a life cycle of a project that adds into the sustainability of the Architectural, Engineering and Construction sector. The study would help to provoke researchers, software developers and practitioners for further innovative effort in holistic Green BIM implementation. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.

TI  - The function and potential of innovative reinforced concrete prefabrication technologies in achieving residential construction goals in germany and poland
PY  - 2021
AU  - Kirschke, P.
AU  - Sietko, D.
AB  - This paper presents the role and potential of housing built using innovative reinforced concrete prefabrication technologies. The subject was presented by investigating the share of such buildings in the achievement of housing goals in Germany and Poland, where they currently constitute one of the most dynamically developing housing sector branches. The phenomenon has been presented via comparative analyses of selected designs by manufacturers from the sector and development companies. Prefabrication is essentially based on optimising architectural and structural solutions and leads to lowering financial and material cost; decreasing project completion time. At present, these goals are achieved by systematising the design and construction process and using the potential offered by building information modelling technology (BIM). This enables coordination between design specialisations and reduces the number of errors, increasing manufacturing and assembly efficiency. Innovative prefabricated technologies are solutions that are either new or are considerably improved in terms of technical specifications, components and materials, that use the latest software, are easy to assemble, durable, energy efficient, can be disassembled and reused and have a low carbon footprint and can be considered aesthetically pleasing. Contemporary prefabricated housing architecture is a combination of innovative technological solutions that enables constructing sustainable architecture and emphasizes the aesthetic features of structural solutions and solutions. © 2021 by the authors.

TI  - Detailed thermodynamic modeling of multi-zone buildings with resistive-capacitive method

AU  - Belić, F.

AB  - Increased use of energy in buildings and HVAC systems requires advanced control schemes like model-based control to improve energy efficiency, which in turn requires accurate thermodynamic models of buildings. The Resistive-Capacitive (RC) method is a popular and versatile approach for thermal modeling of buildings. Despite this, it is not easy to find practical solutions of implementation of the RC method. It is the goal of this paper to clarify the RC method and demonstrate simple implementation of this method, especially for multi-zone buildings, which have more potential for energy savings from use of model-based control. This paper provides two contributions. First is a detailed explanation of the RC method, focusing on its use for developing a structure of a model and first-principles approach for estimation of parameters of a model. Second is a demonstration of an algorithm that enables automatic development of the structure of a model from basic information about a building (layout, construction elements) and its combination with data-based parameter estimation. Use of the algorithm is presented with a case-study on industrial multi-zone building, for which such a grey-box model is developed and analyzed. The resulting model is rapidly developed and used in a simulation with the measured data. The outputs of the model are compared with the measured temperatures and they show good fit. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

TI  - Energy performance of buildings with thermochromic windows in mediterranean climates
PY  - 2021
AU  - Arnaoutakis, G.E.
AU  - Katsaprakakis, D.A.
AB  - This article presents comparative results on the energy performance of buildings in the Mediterranean. Many buildings in the Mediterranean exhibit low energy performance ranking. Thermochromic windows are able to improve the energy consumption by controlling the gains from sunlight. In this article, reference buildings in 15 cities around the Mediterranean are inves-tigated. In this work, a dynamic building information modeling approach is utilized, relying on three-dimensional geometry of office buildings. Calculations of the energy demand based on com-putational simulations of each location were performed, for the estimation of heating and cooling loads. The presented study highlighted the need for high-resolution data for detailed simulation of thermochromic windows in buildings of Mediterranean cities. Temperature is one of the main climate parameters that affect the energy demand of buildings. However, the climate of Mediterranean cities nearby the sea may affect the energy demand. This was more pronounced in cities with arid Mediterranean climate with increased demand in air-conditioning during the summer months. On the other hand, cities with semi-arid Mediterranean climate exhibited relatively increased heating demand. With this parametric approach, the article indicates the energy saving potential of the proposed measures for each Mediterranean city. Finally, these measures can be complemented by overall building passive and active systems for higher energy reductions and increased comfort. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - High-directional resolution radiation intensity (RI) can provide substantial measurement information inside the participating medium, such as the distribution of temperature and physical properties. Therefore, efficiently and accurately solving the radiative transfer equation (RTE) to obtain RI in any direction is the key and challenge of target-detection and inverse-radiation problems. In our previous works [1,2], the integral equation method based on the radiation distribution factor (RDFIEM) was proposed to accurately obtain an arbitrary directional RI. To overcome the inefficiency of the RDFIEM in building a radiation distribution factor (RDF) database from the time-consuming reverse Monte Carlo (RMC) method, a method of equation-solving RDFIEM (ES-RDFIEM) was improved and developed to obtain the solution of RTE in a three-dimensional (3D) anisotropic scattering medium in this work, which can effectively avoid the stochastic ray-tracing process of the traditional RMC method and obtain the value of RDF by solving linear equations directly. The mathematical principles and formulae of ES-RDFIEM are introduced and deduced in detail, whose core idea is to suppose a specified element with a unit blackbody emission, whereas the remaining elements have no energy emission. Subsequently, the linear equations for the RDF, which are only concerned with the physical properties and geometric factors of the radiative system, can be constructed and solved. The computational accuracy and efficiency of ES-RDFIEM and RMC in several cases with different parameters were comprehensively compared. The results showed an excellent agreement between the RDF values and the RI calculated by the two methods. The computational efficiency of ES-RDFIEM was significantly improved compared to RMC, which was almost unaffected by radiation properties. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Building information modelling (BIM) is trying to overcome the issue of interoperability by promoting the collaboration between different professions, which enables Building Performance Assessments (BPA) to take place earlier in the design process. Nevertheless, the interoperability is rarely perfect and information is lost during translation from BIM authoring tool to simulation software or the interoperability is limited to the translation of the geometry. The discrepancies in data translations from BIM authoring tool to specific Calculation Virtual Environments (CVE) for energy and acoustic evaluation are considered. For the energy performance evaluation two software tools are tested in the present research paper, namely the Design Builder and IES VE, using IFC and gbXML as data exchange formats. Furthermore, a solution is proposed for overcoming the interoperability issue about acoustic evaluation by adapting programming language in Dynamo Graphical Interface for calculation of acoustic parameters, namely the Reverberation time and Schroeder's frequency, which allow room quality evaluation to take place earlier in the design process as they are crucial for educational and other facility usage buildings. © 2021 The Authors

AB  - The energy consumption of the building sector has complex and interrelated characteristics. The development of modeling techniques capable of evaluating the impacts of energy-efficient technologies requires great effort owing to the variety of building sizes and geometries, wide range of thermal properties of building envelopes, variable occupant behavior, and lack of measured consumption data. However, energy policies require thorough knowledge of the energy performance of a building stock to be truly effective. In this paper, an urban-scale building energy modeling tool based on an engineering bottom-up approach is presented. The employed methodology makes it possible to assess the energy performance of a building stock, define energy efficiency measures, and evaluate their effects automatically using a geographic information system. Moreover, the modeling tool introduces an innovative urban building energy rating similar to the energy rating of individual buildings. The proposed energy modeling tool is then applied to a real case consisting of three villages in central Italy with 769 residential buildings. © 2021

AB  - The following paper presents a framework for an assessment of energy performance of buildings based on the identification of physical parameters characterizing a building regarding its thermal behavior. Data acquisition within this framework is performed primarily by using UAS, equipped with RGB-camera and thermography-camera for a simultaneous application during the flight. To ensure a reproducible flight for the parallel acquisition of thermography and RGB data, a flight path automatically computed from a basic three-dimensional model is used. An estimation of U-value is applied to the thermography data obtained, allowing the derivation of a probable material set of the investigated structure. The framework also proposes suitable data models for data storage and management to act as a foundation for all algorithmic components, including numerical assessment of energy performance of buildings. Conclusively the framework is applied on a school building illustrating the previously defined methods. The validation of the Building Performance Simulation (BPS) performed within this framework shows an oscillation of Mean Bias Error (MBE) for the heat demand between −6.4% and 6.3%. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - System-level virtual sensing method in building energy systems using autoencoder: Under the limited sensors and operational datasets

AB  - Sensing networks and their environments are essential in intelligent building systems because of their increasing dependency on operational data. Virtual sensing technology has been applied in building energy systems to provide the more reliable and informative sensing environments. However, conventional virtual sensors still have structural and practical limitations under the physical sensor absences and limited datasets. Existing virtual sensors are separately developed by modeling multiple input variables and a single target (Xs to Y), which is the variable-level virtual sensor (VLVS); therefore, these virtual sensors cannot benefit by either using their target variable (Y) or by considering other virtual sensors when developing the models. This can result in insufficient accuracy, particularly in the limited sensors. Herein, to overcome these limitations, a novel virtual sensing framework, system-level virtual sensing (SLVS), is proposed for building energy systems using an autoencoder. Two strategies are also proposed. The autoencoder-based SLVS with the two strategies was applied in a real operational district heating system. The first strategy showed an improved accuracy using a new assistance virtual sensor, which is derived by additional information and knowledge regarding system design, control, and devices. It could also overcome the training data dependency in the limited datasets. The second strategy provided a replacement function for the SLVS specialized for backup and a calibration effect for the existing VLVS. Thus, the results showed that the suggested SLVS can achieve multifunctional high-accuracy virtual sensing; the accuracies of 99.89%, 99.68%, and 97.91% were shown respectively for temperatures, pressures, and control signals. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Climate mitigation and efficient use of resources in the building sector have become a central issue for sustainable development. Promoting a circular economy and reducing global warming at the same time is an increasingly important challenge for construction, demolition and recycling of buildings. This study assesses the greenhouse gas emissions in relation to the resource use of recycled concrete (RC-concrete) and transfers the results into a Building Information Modelling application for visualization of the footprints results. The town hall building in the German city of Korbach was selected as a case study, which was selectively demolished and rebuilt with RC-concrete using recycled aggregates from the old building. The production of RC-concrete is compared with conventional concrete made from natural aggregates. The analysis covers the end of life and the production phase of concrete within the life cycle assessment (LCA) boundaries. The environmental assessment is done based on product climate, energy, material and water footprints, as reliable benchmarks for climate and resource efficiency in the building sector. RC-concrete can decrease the material footprint by up to 50%, whereas the reduction potential for the climate footprint is limited and the water footprint can be up to ten times higher with wet processing of concrete waste. The visualization of footprint results using LCA and digital planning software will further enhance the low carbon architectural design and circularity in the building sector. © 2021 The Authors

AB  - The existing building energy-efficient design relies highly on repeated modelling and it is difficult to obtain an alternative with desired performances as the decision-making procedure is normally too subjective. To improve the accuracy and efficiency, we aim to propose the intelligent optimization method, a user-friendly framework to automatize the whole energy-efficient design process from building information modelling to decision-making. Parametric programming and interface program design are adopted to realize the function of adaptive cooperative adjustment modelling and real time automatic data interaction between different modules with design efficiency enhanced. A decision-making method based on Self-Organizing Map clustering integrated with NSGA-II optimization algorithm is proposed to increase the accuracy of energy-efficient design. An experiment is performed to assess the effectiveness from design accuracy and efficiency as well as applicability with evaluation factors put forward. The experiment is carried out on a typical building in severe cold regions by comparing with two commonly used methods of subjective decision-making design and simulation aided design. The results show that the proposed framework is applicable by architects and performs better in design accuracy and efficiency compared with the other two methods. The performance levels of the compared three objectives are improved by 25.23%, 9.84%, 3.87% respectively and 87.5% time of a day is saved for architects to do other work. Thus, the intelligent optimization framework is a promising method to automatize the multi-objective optimization process of daylighting and energy performances by architects with both design accuracy and efficiency enhanced. The effectiveness evaluation method of different frameworks using experiment will benefit the selection and development of more applicable tools used by architects in future. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The high amount of energy consumption demanded by buildings entails the worsening of several environmental issues. Therefore, actions to make use of this resource more efficient become necessary. The most used methods of Building Energy Modeling (BEM) designated to assess the functionality of such actions are excessively complex and, in many cases, generate unreliable results. Thus, this work aims to elaborate an approach based on Building Information Modeling (BIM) to improve energy efficiency in buildings in a simplified and user-oriented manner. For this purpose, a case study was developed in which two classrooms of an educational building, located in the Amazon region – Brazil, were subjected to three-dimensional modeling and energy simulations in BIM software. In addition to evaluating the classrooms’ current performance regarding daylight, thermal conditions and energy consumption, such simulations intended to assess the implantation of two strategies that sought to reduce energy consumption and maintain thermal and visual comfort by taking advantage of daylight and natural ventilation. Besides of energy saving, such strategies were chosen as they promote Indoor Environmental Quality (IEQ) and help to mitigate the indoor transmission of infectious agents, which is fundamental due to the COVID-19 pandemic scenario, especially in educational environments. The results showed that the strategy based on daylight contribution generated energy savings of around 8% for one of the rooms, and 12% for the other, while the one that exploited the use of natural ventilation was able to reduce energy consumption by about 7% for one of the rooms, and 9% for the other. Therefore, this research presents an important contribution as it provides an intelligible workflow that makes the energy simulation process friendlier and more intuitive and that was able to generate plausible results using BIM-BEM interoperability. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Refrigerators consume significantly high energy and the improvement on their efficiency is essential to minimize greenhouse gas emission. Understanding the power consumption patterns of refrigerators is a key element that is not thoroughly studied, especially in domestic PV system with an integrated battery-storage. Therefore, the main objective of the study is to develop strategies in decreasing the energy consumptions of systems including inverter-driven refrigerators in commercial and residential sectors. This paper compares measurements of the power consumption of two types of appliances, inverter-driven and traditional/non-inverter driven refrigerators when operating in DC and AC environment. The energy consumption was measured experimentally at four different temperatures from 10 °C to 40 °C to provide information on underlying energy changes due to changes during normal use. The work proposes an efficient configuration with DC environment appropriate for PV with battery storage applications. The overall system efficiency is adopted as a factor to evaluate the system performance for comparing two DC system topologies, DC-Load and DC-inverter-load. The comparison results of size equivalent refrigerators indicated that around 300 Wh of daily energy can be saved when just switching to the new inverter technology and smoother power pattern, especially at higher ambient temperatures. The results also found that the voltage level (310–325)VDC is the most appropriate value for the photovoltaic system integrated with battery storage of DC environment. This study provides researchers reasonable estimates on the daily energy consumption for other refrigerators at different operating conditions. © 2021

AB  - Purpose: This study investigates the impact and economic viability of energy-efficient building envelope and orientation for contributing net zero energy building (NZEB) and suggests optimum thermal insulation thickness, optimum wall thickness, appropriate orientation and glazing types of window in the contexts of unique Bangladeshi subtropical monsoon climate. Design/methodology/approach: The whole study was conducted through energy simulation perspective of an existing office building using building information modeling (BIM) and building energy modeling (BEM) tools which are Autodesk Revit 2017, Autodesk Green Building Studio (GBS) and eQUEST. Numerous simulation patterns were created for energy simulation considering building envelope parameters and orientations. A comprehensive data analysis of simulation results was conducted to sort out efficient passive design strategies. Findings: The optimum thermal mass and thermal insulation thickness are 6.5 and 0.5 inches, respectively, considering energy performance and economic viability. This study highly recommends that a building should be designed with a small window-to-wall ratio in the south and west face. The window should be constructed with double glazing Low-E materials to reduce solar heat gain. The studied building saves 9.14% annual energy consumption by incorporating the suggested passive design strategies of this study. Originality/value: The output of this work can add some new energy-efficient design strategies to Bangladesh National Building Code (BNBC) because BNBC has not suggested any codes or regulations regarding energy-efficient passive design strategies. It will also be useful to designers of Bangladesh and other countries with similar subtropical climatic contexts which are located in Southeast Asia and Northern Hemisphere of Earth. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - The residential sector accounts for an increasing amount of global energy use with continued urbanization. Residential energy-informed urban planning offers an economical and easy-to-operate approach to achieve more efficient urban energy utilization. However, quantifying the interactions between residential energy and urban planning remains an open challenge. This study proposes a holistic approach integrating GIS techniques, building energy modeling, and a global sensitivity analysis to prioritize eight key urban planning factors on the community energy performance based on a building energy dataset. The dataset, including urban planning and building information, was first established using GIS techniques and validated using survey data. The residential energy performance model at the community scale was developed using the clustering tree structure of residential building prototypes and building performance simulations. A combined data-driven and global sensitivity analysis approach was further applied to prioritize the impacts of eight vital urban planning factors on energy use intensity and peak load intensity. A case study of 1963 communities in Shanghai revealed that, for the energy performance of residential communities, the floor area ratio and building coverage ratio are the most influential factors, followed by the maximum height and high-rise proportion having a relatively low impact but higher than other factors. Overall, the proposed holistic approach generates robust insights into urban-scale residential energy performance, which can effectively inform urban planners to achieve more energy-efficient regulatory planning. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Latent heat thermal energy storages (LHTES) are a promising technology with a wide range of applications in the framework of energy efficiency improvement. Phase change materials provide a big storage capacity, but their thermal conductivities are always extremely low. The use of finned tube heat exchangers is nowadays the best solution to enhance PCMs thermal performances. This allows significant charging and discharging rates. The major challenge concerns the balance between thermal performances and high material costs. A proper design of the heat transfer surfaces is essential to limit the system overall cost. Two different heat exchangers solutions, with radial and longitudinal fins are here examined. The design of the LHTES is performed by deploying a simplified FEM numerical model specifically developed for the application. A validation procedure based on laboratory tests with a small LHTES prototype was also carried out. The obtained results confirmed the reliability of the numerical model and justify its adoption as a tool for the design phase. The FEM model allows to effectively simulate the system thermal behaviour and assess the impact of the different HEX geometrical parameters on thermal performances. Based on this information it was possible to perform the optimization of the heat transfer surfaces and to derive the best heat exchanger layout in terms of material usage. The results showed that the solution with longitudinal fins is the most efficient, with 215 kg of steel less required for the realization of the finned heat exchanger. © 2021 The Authors.

AB  - Linking Building Information Modelling and Building Energy Modelling methodologies appear as a tool for the energy performance analysis of a dwelling, being able to build the physical model via Autodesk Revit and simulating the energy modeling with its complement Autodesk Insight. A residential two-story house was evaluated in five different locations within distinct climatic zones to reduce its electricity demand. Experimental Design is used as a methodological tool to define the possible arrangement of results emitted via Autodesk Insight that exhibits the minor electric demand, considering three variables: Lighting efficiency, Plug-Load Efficiency, and HVAC systems. The analysis concluded that while the higher the efficiency of lighting and applications, the lower the electric demand. In addition, the type of climate and thermal characteristics of the materials that conform to the building envelope have significant effects on the energetic performance. The adjustment of different energetic measures and its comparison with other climatic zones enable decision-makers to choose the best combination of variables for developing strategies to lower the electric demand towards energy-efficient buildings. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Buildings consume around 40% of energy and emit 36% of CO2 emissions and, as the largest single energy consumer in Europe, offer the opportunity for significant savings. Building energy labels, also known as Energy Performance Certificates, are a method of providing home buyers with information about the estimated energy consumption of a particular home, enabling them to make more informed decisions in the property market and hopefully encouraging the construction of more energy-efficient homes because of the extra premiums they should charge. There is imperfect information available on the cost-saving effects of efficiency improvements, and the aim of this paper is to examine the role of current building energy labels and the effects of framing this information in terms of its monetary impact on energy bills by conducting a discrete choice experiment. The modelling results show that when monetary estimates are included as part of Energy Performance Certificates, the willingness to pay for higher levels of building energy performance increases by 47%. These results suggest that the inclusion of such monetary information has the potential to increase the value that consumers attach to more energy-efficient homes, thereby creating an incentive to either build better energy-efficient homes or retrofit current housing stock to increase its value. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - In recent years, a growing number of enterprises have taken different steps to reduce the energy consumption and carbon emissions of information and communication technology (ICT) as-sets. Because of the expansion of digitalization and the need for rapid access to information, enterprises have been compelled to optimize the location and utilization of their ICT hardware. In this context, this paper presents a novel method based on a mixed-integer linear programming approach for optimizing the physical location and task allocation of printing devices in office floor plans considering the power usage of the ICT assets, the costs related to the purchase and service of the individual devices, operating costs, and distance between employees and printing devices. The applicability of the proposed model is illustrated using the case study of a company with 100 functional departments located in several office buildings across Poland. The results reveal that the model guarantees the execution of all printing tasks and satisfies the functionality requirements expressed by the users of the workstations. Moreover, the selection of more energy-efficient printing devices leads to a considerable reduction in electricity consumption, related not only to the direct operation of these devices but also to their modes of operation (work, idle, or sleep). Such results also bring tangible effects in reducing carbon dioxide emissions, which is particularly important for businesses operating in countries where fossil fuels still dominate the energy mix. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Smart energy services and technologies are key components of energy transition and decarbonisation strategies for the built environment. On the one hand, the technical potential of the building stock in terms of energy, emissions and cost savings is large and exploited only partially at present. On the other hand, the increasing availability of data generated by smart meters, smart devices, sensors and building management systems can help monitoring, verifying and tracking building energy performance improvements in a transparent way. In particular, energy modelling and data analytics can provide empirically grounded and tested methods to standardize the way energy performance is measured and reported. Further, techno-economic analysis is crucial to ensure the feasibility of innovative business models. For these reasons, this paper aims to address the role of techno-economic analysis and energy modelling as key enablers for next-generation energy services and technologies. In terms of methods, scientific literature selection criteria are derived from previous research and are focused on limitations and bottlenecks to the achievement of innovative business models, which are motivated, at their very basics, by energy, emission and cost savings. Additionally, besides these potential savings, smart energy services and technologies can provide multiple additional benefits such as improved Indoor Environmental Quality (IEQ) and energy flexibility on the demand side, with respect to energy infrastructures. First, the research identifies the key elements that are necessary to integrate and to streamline techno-economic analysis and energy modelling processes. After that, it highlights potential advances in the broad area of energy transitions and decarbonisation of the built environment that can be achieved as an evolution of current practices and processes. Finally, it envisions the creation of “eco-systems” of interacting models for the building sector that share common underlying principles. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In recent years advances in digital tools have been leading the way in the construction of cleaner, more energy-efficient buildings. Furthermore, improvements in Building Information Modelling (BIM) have resulted in various tools being used to assess building performance and overall Life Cycle Analysis (LCA). This work offers a unique insight into the development of a parametric LCA BIM tool, focusing on both operational and embodied energy perspectives through case study analysis of a commercial and a domestic building in the UK. A mixed research method was employed combining a literature review, qualitative and quantitative LCA case study analysis, and parametric modelling. The results indicate that embodied energy is much more critical in the early stages of the building's life, then is quickly overtaken by operational energy. In addition, many variations exist in energy outputs between domestic and commercial buildings. Operational energy takes a significant share in domestic buildings compared to commercial buildings. These variations are attributed to different design methods, construction materials, occupancy patterns and energy demands. The study proposes an LCA-BIM interactive user-led method of addressing energy hotspots for both operational and embodied elements, which can provide more instant identification of energy critical areas. Such an approach can offer real alternative BIM-based analysis tools during the design stages, compared to those currently being used, which focus mainly on either LCA of operational or embodied energy. © 2021 The Author(s)

TI  - Drivers of consumers’ change to an energy-efficient heating appliance (EEHA) in households: Evidence from five European countries
PY  - 2021
AU  - Neves, C.

AB  - Residential buildings are significant contributors to global energy consumption. Hence, numerous articles have studied occupants’ energy behaviors to promote households’ change toward energy efficiency. However, the drivers of these behaviors, analyzed in a unified view of several perspectives, have not been fully explored in the literature. Moreover, the intention to adopt an energy-efficient heating appliance (EEHA) has never been investigated in order to understand what drives people to change their current appliances. To fill this gap, our work gathers six relevant contexts (triggers, barriers, engagement, house characteristics, co-benefits, and communication channels) to predict behavior change (both attitude on heating equipment use and intention to change to an EEHA). We tested our model based on a sample of 1611 observations collected in five European countries, using structural equation modeling. Our work reveals the significance of energy efficiency and labeling as motivations, and operation and maintenance as barriers. Co-benefits and communication channels also greatly affect consumer behavior intention, namely organizational and web media channels. Our results also emphasize the importance of consumer engagement in the topic of energy, being the strongest effect on behavior intention. These findings have practical implications for both energy and governmental organizations to increase households’ energy efficiency. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Aerodynamic characteristics of tall buildings with porous double-skin façades: State of the art and future perspectives
PY  - 2021
AU  - Škvorc, P.
AU  - Kozmar, H.
AB  - Double-skin façades (DSFs) have been increasingly implemented on tall buildings with the goal of improving building energy efficiency, natural ventilation and visual appearance. It is commonly known that wind and earthquakes represent major environmental load types impacting tall buildings. However, at this point, the aerodynamic characteristics of tall buildings equipped with porous façades are still relatively unknown, although it may be expected that the addition of porous outer skins will substantially affect the overall building aerodynamics. The scope of the present study is therefore to carefully review all the relevant parameters playing an important role in the aerodynamic characteristics of tall buildings with porous façades. Fluid flow and turbulence through porous surfaces were reviewed first with an emphasis on the wake and pressure drop behind perforated plates to analyze the phenomena of fundamental fluid mechanics relevant for porous surfaces. As the inflow characteristics predominantly dictate the aerodynamic characteristics of tall buildings, it is therefore useful to review major wind types, including the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) and strong local winds, which have previously proved to cause major structural damage and failure. In order to be able to properly assess the aerodynamic loading of tall buildings with porous façades, it is necessary to understand the aerodynamic features of tall buildings with smooth surfaces. For this reason, the aerodynamic performance of smooth tall buildings was reviewed, as were the design features commonly adopted to mitigate adverse wind effects. The existing and rather sparse current knowledge of the aerodynamic characteristics of porous DSFs of high- and low-rise buildings is outlined. Based on the provided information, it is clear that a substantial amount of knowledge still needs to be acquired in the future in regard to various aerodynamic features of tall buildings with porous DSFs, particularly concerning wind loads, building energy efficiency, pedestrian wind comfort, renewable energy aspects, air pollution dispersion and dilution. It is expected that the optimal approach to advancing this topic is in combining field measurements, laboratory experiments and computational modeling. Copyright © 2021 Techno-Press, Ltd.

AB  - Ever since the appearance of Building Information Modeling (BIM), it has been developed to be used in managing newly constructed buildings through monitoring climate change impacts on buildings hence, predicting its energy performance. Later on, the term Heritage Building Information Modeling HBIM offered the historic aspect missing, where the focus shifted towards existing heritage buildings in use. HBIM has also benefitted from the rising technology of big data and smart sensing in the monitoring, sorting, storing and managing information and live data with the use of remote digital platforms which provides a sample of big data adaption where life information can be monitored, documented, hence accessed when needed. The main objective of the paper is to represent a framework for monitoring and visualizing energy performance of heritage buildings by means of smart sensing through the use of digital platforms.

TI  - Optimization of intelligent heating ventilation air conditioning system in urban building based on bim and artificial intelligence technology
PY  - 2021
AU  - Liu, Z.
AU  - Jiang, G.
AB  - The study aims to effectively reduce building energy consumption, improve the utilization efficiency of building resources, reduce the emission of pollutants and greenhouse gases, and protect the ecological environment. A prediction model of heating ventilation air conditioning (HVAC) energy consumption is established by using back propagation neural network (BPNN) and adapted boosting (Adaboost) algorithm. Then, the HVAC system is optimized by building information modeling (BIM). Finally, the effectiveness of the urban intelligent HVAC optimization prediction model based on BIM and artificial intelligence (AI) is further verified by simulation experiments. The research shows that the error of the prediction model is reduced, the accuracy is higher after the Adaboost algorithm is added to BPNN, and the average prediction accuracy is 86%. When the BIM is combined with the prediction model, the HVAC programme of hybrid cooling beam + variable air volume reheating is taken as the optimal programme of HVAC system. The power consumption and gas consumption of the programme are the least, and the CO2 emission is also the lowest. Programme 1 is compared with programme 3, and the cost is saved by 37% and 15%, respectively. Through the combination of BIM technology and AI technology, the energy consumption of HVAC is effectively reduced, and the resource utilization rate is significantly improved, which can provide theoretical basis for the research of energy-saving equipment. © 2021, ComSIS Consortium.

AB  - In competitive growth and Industry 4.0, construction prediction and management have a key role. To find a way to provide a simulation method for the damage assessment of buildings and Industry 4.0, building information modelling technology is the most suitable choice. This work presents and analyses the building material from design modelling to model information extraction, virtual construction, and an imported virtual simulation engine. A simulation system has been built to understand the force and material collision detection of buildings, and a three-dimensional (3D) simulation platform is developed based on the Unity3D engine. A 3D display of building model and simulation data is realized in this work based on the simulation software platform. The results show that the building 3D simulation images constructed by the designed system are high definition, take little time, and have excellent performance. The outcomes are realized in terms of the engineering cost ratio and have energy consumption and efficiency values of 20% and 40%, respectively, which are much better than the traditional method. Efficiency has also improved to 76% from the traditional method using the proposed method, which makes it a robust platform for construction prediction and management in industries. The virtual simulation technology is applied to solve problems of building design and damage assessment. The influence of this technology on the overall design of the building is discussed, followed by future development directions for industrial automation. © 2021 The Authors.

AB  - Interpretable and scalable data-driven methodologies providing high granularity baseline predictions of energy use in buildings are essential for the accurate measurement and verification of energy renovation projects and have the potential of unlocking considerable investments in energy efficiency worldwide. Bayesian methodologies have been demonstrated to hold great potential for energy baseline modelling, by providing richer and more valuable information using intuitive mathematics. This paper proposes a Bayesian linear regression methodology for hourly baseline energy consumption predictions in commercial buildings. The methodology also enables a detailed characterization of the analyzed buildings through the detection of typical electricity usage profiles and the estimation of the weather dependence. The effects of different Bayesian model specifications were tested, including the use of different prior distributions, predictor variables, posterior estimation techniques, and the implementation of multilevel regression. The approach was tested on an open dataset containing two years of electricity meter readings at an hourly frequency for 1578 non-residential buildings. The best performing model specifications were identified, among the ones tested. The results show that the methodology developed is able to provide accurate high granularity baseline predictions, while also being intuitive and explainable. The building consumption characterization provides actionable information that can be used by energy managers to improve the performance of the analyzed facilities. Copyright: © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - District heating (DH) has a major potential to increase the efficiency, security, and sus-tainability of energy management at the community scale. However, there is a huge challenge for decision makers due to the lack of knowledge about thermal energy demand during a year. Thermal energy demand is strongly dependent on the outdoor temperature, building area, and activities. In this context, this paper presents an innovative monthly thermal energy mapping method to calculate and visualize heat demand accurately for various types of buildings. The method includes three consecutive phases: (i) calculating energy loss, (ii) completing a dataset that includes energy and building information, and (iii) generating the monthly heat demand maps for the community. Determining the amount of demand and the best location for energy generators from the perspective of energy efficiency in a DH system in an urban context is one of the important applications of heat maps. Exploring heat demand characteristics and visualizing them on maps is the foundation of smart DHs. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - In recent years, interest in home energy management systems (HEMS) has grown significantly, as well as the development of Voice Assistants that substantially increase home comfort. This paper presents a novel merging of HEMS with the Assistant paradigm. The combination of both concepts has allowed the creation of a high‐performance and easy‐to‐manage expert system (ES). It has been developed in a framework that includes, on the one hand, the efficient energy management functionality boosted with an Internet of Things (IoT) platform, where artificial intelligence (AI) and big data treatment are blended, and on the other hand, an assistant that interacts both with the user and with the HEMS itself. The creation of this ES has made it possible to optimize consumption levels, improve security, efficiency, comfort, and user experience, as well as home security (presence simulation or security against intruders), automate processes, optimize resources, and provide relevant information to the user facilitating decision making, all based on a multi‐objective optimization (MOP) problem model. This paper presents both the scheme and the results obtained, the synergies generated, and the conclusions that can be drawn after 24 months of operation. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - The building sector is a major source of energy consumption mainly due to the use of Heat Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems, to achieve the indoor thermal comfort of occupants. To reach the optimal energy-efficient indoor temperature that satisfies thermal comfort, this paper describes an optimization approach named ‘DynamicPMV’ combining BIM (Building Information and Modeling) and IoT sensors (Internet of Things). This integration allows taking advantage of the geometric and parametric richness of BIM models and the real-time streaming of environmental data (humidity, temperature, etc.) collected by IoT sensors to optimize the indoor thermal comfort. First, the IoT measurements are interpolated according to a regular three-dimensional grid while considering inter-room heat exchanges using the parametric information of the BIM model. Then, DynamicPMV allows real-time 3D visualization of thermal comfort using the Predicted Mean Vote (PMV) index. Finally, the optimal temperature to ensure indoor thermal comfort is calculated. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Modular construction has attracted increasing attention due to its energy and environmental benefits. Digital technologies such as building information modelling (BIM) have also been explored to generate and manage data through the lifecycle of buildings. Although research has been performed in the area of integrating BIM and modular construction, BIM-based automated lifecycle assessment (LCA) of prefabricated buildings remains unexplored. This study therefore aims to develop a BIM-based LCA method for prefabricated buildings incorporating different assessment levels with unique system boundaries and functional units. The developed approach can support automated assessments through all lifecycle phases of a prefabricated building. It is achieved through an automated process of creating parameters to merge LCA data into the building model, systematic zoning, model setup and impact estimation. This approach is applied to evaluate the energy and environmental performances of a case building in Hong Kong. The case study validated the efficiency of the developed BIM-based LCA method in providing a systematic and detailed assessment of modularly designed buildings. This study extends the knowledge in automated BIM-based LCA by addressing specific characteristics of prefabrication and promotes the incorporation of comprehensive and detailed LCA data into BIM models for improved design robustness and holistic performances of buildings. This validated approach will enhance the willingness of designers to apply LCA during the design stages for minimizing the energy and environmental impacts of both new and renovated buildings with prefabrication. © 2021

AB  - Control logic programs determine the behavior of Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems under different operating conditions. Faults in control logic account for more than 15% of all HVAC system problems, causing energy waste and occupancy discomfort. The first step towards systematically detecting and diagnosing control logic faults is to have an unambiguous control logic fault definition so that the existence of control logic faults in an HVAC system can be discovered from its operational data. In order to have high level of fault detection accuracy, the control logic fault definition needs to be customized for different HVAC systems as they have different components and control sequences. In this paper, we propose an object-oriented classification approach to systematically define customized control logic faults in terms of control logic input/output variable expressions. Focusing on air handling unit (AHU) systems, and their general operation objectives of energy efficiency and occupancy comfort, we elaborated four control goals and developed corresponding reasoning mechanisms to derive fault definitions. We also developed an HVAC component and control information ontology to be used in these reasoning mechanisms by extending existing HVAC information models. The prototype of the developed approach was tested with 27 common AHUs specified by the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE), and the results show that using the developed approach, it is possible to define a customized set of control logic faults applicable to each specific AHU with an overall precision of 94.2% and recall of 83.0%. This demonstrates the generality of our proposed approach in providing customized control logic fault definitions for different types of AHUs. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Building sector professionals, together with building physicists and human scientists, recognize the occupants' key role in determining final buildings energy needs. Occupants’ behavior is strongly influenced by their perception and represents a major variable affecting buildings' energy performance, but its impact is difficult to predict since the early design stage. This study proposes a new analysis framework and field test method to better comprehend and monitor people environmental perception and attitudes since the design stage, while stimulated through immersive environment modeled in a parametric platform, able to change every specific aspect of the future spaces. To this aim, a physical office room was re-designed through virtual reality (VR) and sense-of-presence feeling was registered, with a 76% of satisfaction rate. The VR designed environment was therefore used to reproduce key design variables without modifying the indoor thermal-energy environment during the experiment. Three triggers were simulated, i.e. glass filter, window aspect ratio, and artificial lighting color temperature. Both these two latter variables significantly produced placebo effects on most of the interviewed people, who declared to feel relatively hotter in high aspect ratio window conditions and low color temperature. As expected, non-thermal triggers may affect indoor thermal perception and, potentially, may induce better thermal satisfaction and energy saving behaviors, if properly considered. The proposed novel method can assist building design since the early stages, leading to low-cost and human-centric energy efficiency enhancements. © 2021

AB  - Carbon-neutral design is pivotal for achieving the future energy performance targets of buildings. This paper shows research projects that promote the environmental sustainability of university campuses at the international level. GHG accounting methods and operational strategies adopted by the University of Genoa (UNIGE), Italy, and the Florida International University (FIU) in Miami, USA, are compared, with both universities striving to make buildings and campus facilities benchmarked and carbon neutral in the near future. Our comparative research includes analyzing campus buildings at both universities and their attempts to design, retrofit, and transform these buildings into carbon neutral buildings. Two case studies were discussed: the Smart Energy Building (SEB) in the Savona Campus of the UNIGE, and the Paul L. Cejas School of Architecture (PCA) Building of the FIU. The SEB’s construction reduced emissions by about 86 tCO2/y, whereas the PCA’s retrofitting reduced GHG emissions by 30%. Other operational strategies, including energy efficiency and energy generation, allowed the UNIGE to reduce their overall Scope 1 + 2 GHG emissions by 25% from 2013 to 2016. Globally, FIU Scope 1 + 2 GHG emissions per person were found to result in more than three times the UNIGE’s emissions, and 2.4 times if evaluated per square meter. The results were compared with GHG emissions and operational strategies from other universities. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Worldwide, the design, renovation, and sustainable management of port buildings play a crucial role for sustainability. In this framework, a computer simulation of a building’s thermal behaviour is an almost mandatory tool for making informed decisions. However, the development of a building energy model is a challenging task that could discourage its adoption. A possible solution would be to exploit an existing Building Information Modeling (BIM) model to automatically generate an accurate and flexible Building Energy Modeling (BEM) one. Such a method, which can substantially improve decision-making processes, still presents some issues and needs to be further investigated, as also detectable from the literature on the topic. In this framework, a novel workflow to extrapolate BIM data for energy simulation is proposed and analysed in this paper. Here, the BIM to BEM approach was tested as a useful tool for the maritime industry to improve the implementation of effective energy-saving measures. Specifically, in order to prove the capabilities of the proposed method, a maritime passenger station in Naples was chosen as case study and investigated by comparing different strategies to reduce the annual primary energy consumption. The optimal level of modelling detail required by a trustable building energy assessment was also investigated. By the proposed method, interesting primary energy savings (ranging from 24 to 41%) are achieved and CO2 emissions avoided (ranging from 16 to 34 tons CO2/year) for the investigated building, proving the potential of this approach. Definitely, this paper proves the validity of the proposed methodology and emphasizes its numerous benefits towards the achievements of the most modern sustainability standards. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - The energy efficiency of buildings is a key condition in the implementation of national sustainability policies. Energy efficiency of the built heritage is usually achieved through energy contracts or renovation projects that are based on decisions often taken with limited knowledge and in short time frames. However, the collection of comprehensive and reliable technical information to support the decision process is a long and expensive activity. Approximate assessment methods based on stationary thermal models are usually adopted, often introducing unacceptable uncertainties for economically onerous contracts. Hence, it is important to develop tools that, by capitalizing on the operators’ experience, can provide support for fast and reliable assessments. The paper documents the development of a decision support system prototype for the management of energy refurbishment investments in the residential building sector that assists operators in the energy performance assessment, using a limited set of technical information. The system uses a Case Based paradigm enriched with probabilistic modelling to implement decision support within the corporate’s knowledge management framework. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Carbon emissions and greenhouse gases emitted into the atmosphere are one of the reasons the globe is facing this threatening condition. The adoption of sustainable approach becomes global acceptance as an alternative solution. This paper studies on the perception of professional views on green building energy efficiency. The goal of this study is to recognize the potential integration of the Green Building Index (GBI) with Building Information Modeling (BIM) to reduce the effect of carbon emissions. The use of Green Building Index as energy simulation tools to heighten green buildings adoption may help to mitigate environmental effects. By promoting improved communication between the stakeholders (owner, contractor, building product manufacturer, and design professional), it may result in minimizing cost-related procedures, time-saving and controlling energy needs through improved design. There is a high agreement between practitioners that BIM-GBI provides a better energy model that enables the design team to provide owners with better value and reduce energy needs by informed design. Thus the energy consumption could be decreased by integrating BIM-GBI while the carbon emissions could be reduced as well. © 2021, Books and Journals Private Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - This study proposes a building energy simulation (BES) model of an air‐to‐water heat pump (AWHP) system integrated with a multi‐span greenhouse using the TRNSYS‐18 program. The proposed BES model was validated using an experimental AWHP and a multi‐span greenhouse installed in Kyungpook National University, Daegu, South Korea (latitude 35.53° N, longitude 128.36° E, elevation 48 m). Three AWHPs and a water storage tank were used to fulfill the heat energy requirement of the three‐span greenhouse with 391.6 m2 of floor area. The model was validated by comparing the following experimental and simulated results, namely, the internal greenhouse temperature, the heating load of the greenhouse, heat supply from the water storage tank to the greenhouse, heat pumps’ output water temperature, power used by the heat pumps, coefficient of performance (COP) of the heat pump, and water storage tank temperature. The BES model’s performance was evaluated by calculating the root mean square error (RMSE) and the Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) coefficient of validation results. The overall results correlated well with the experimental and simulated results and encouraged adopting the BES model. The average calculated COP of the AWHP was 2.2 when the outside temperature was as low as −13 °C. The proposed model was designed simply, and detailed information of each step is provided to make it easy to use for engineers, researchers, and consultants. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Nowadays, the computational simulation of the energy consumption in buildings is a key issue to determine the most proficient configuration between the construction solutions and the necessary equipment, without compromising comfort and accomplishing the legal requirements for each country. The feasible and most profitable solutions can lead to minimizing CO2 emissions and environmental impact. In this work, the internal enclosures influencing the evaluation of energy consumption by energy simulation have been analysed in order to obtain an accurate solution when all the information regarding the internal partitions is not available. The main aim of the present research was to evaluate the role of internal distribution in the simulations of the total building energy consumption. Differences between the results of the energy simulations of buildings that are calculated considering their internal distribution, and those in which only the exterior geometry that makes up the perimeter of the envelope are being described. In this way, it is intended to establish a correction factor based on the building typology and the European climate zone that allows simulation tools to describe the energy reality of a building without knowing its internal distribution. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - To utilize the energy in the thermal effluent, many attempts have been made to use the thermal effluent for agricultural facilities such as greenhouses. As the first step, it is important to estimate the energy loads of the greenhouse for deciding a suitable scale for the heating and cooling. Then, it is available to estimate the energy efficiency of the thermal effluent heat pump system installed in the greenhouse. Therefore, the main objectives of this study were to design and validate an energy model of the experimental greenhouse growing Irwin mangoes and to estimate the annual and maximum energy loads using building energy simulation (BES). Field experiments were conducted in a multi-span plastic-covered greenhouse growing Irwin mangoes to measure the internal environments of the greenhouse and crop characteristics. The energy exchange model of the greenhouse considering crop, cladding, heat pump was developed using BES. The BES model was validated using the data measured at field experiments. The designed model was found to be able to provide satisfactory estimates of the changes of the internal air temperature of the greenhouse (R2 = 0.94 and d = 0.97). The hourly energy loads computed by using the validated model were used to analyse the periodic and maximum energy loads according to the growth stage of the cultivated crops. Finally, the energy costs were compared according to the type of energy source based on the calculated annual energy loads. The average energy cost when using the thermal effluent—heat pump system was found to be 68.21% lower than that when a kerosene boiler was used. © 2021 by the authors.

TI  - Mind the Energy Performance Gap: testing the accuracy of building Energy Performance Certificates in Ireland
PY  - 2021
AU  - Coyne, B.
AU  - Denny, E.
AB  - Ireland’s Climate Action Plan aims upgrade 500,000 homes to B2 Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) standard by 2030. Evidence of an Energy Performance Gap, where actual energy use differs from the EPC, could undermine progress towards such targets. This paper studies the energy performance gap for a general housing sample (n = 9923) over multiple years. It provides a novel comparison between whole-home energy use (electricity and gas) that accounts for fuel switching and removes potential rebound effects by excluding households that may have changed their behaviour following a retrofit. Results suggest that actual energy use is unresponsive to the EPC, with a range of 457 kWh/year observed across EPC-level averages for the entire sample. This difference equated to less than 5% of the sample average annual energy use observed. The Energy Performance Gap range features an average deficit of 17% below theoretical energy use. The least energy efficient dwellings feature an average difference ranging from − 15 to − 56% of the relevant EPC. Conversely, energy efficient houses display higher-than-theoretical energy use, with average surpluses ranging from 39 to 54% of the relevant EPC. Results sound a note of caution for policymakers that rely on a theoretical EPC to deliver real energy savings. Future EPCs could be improved by incorporating historical household energy usage to help improve models. © 2021, The Author(s).

TI  - A novel reduced order model technology framework to support the estimation of the energy savings in building retrofits

AU  - Keane, M.M.
AB  - Energy Performance Contracting (EPC), as a tool to enhance energy efficiency of buildings, can accelerate investment in cost-effective energy conservation measures (ECMs) for existing buildings. However, there are many risks and barriers that can slow down the uptake of EPC, such as the complexity of the process or uncertainty of building performance post-retrofit. The International Performance Measurement and Verification Protocol (IPMVP®), which was originally developed to help increase investment in energy and water efficiency, demand management and renewable energy projects, has the potential to reduce some of the EPC barriers. However, due to limited and uncertain information about existing buildings, the application of this Measurement and Verification (M&V) protocol in retrofitting projects is often complex and requires novel use of building simulation tools. In order to address the challenges of utilising M&V IPMVP® in building retrofitting projects, and to enhance the uptake of EPC, the research presented here developed a novel Reduced Order Model (ROM) technology framework that can be used for (i) systematic quantification of energy savings (avoided energy consumption) achieved through ECMs, and (ii) direct estimation of energy savings through the investigation of different envelope retrofit scenarios. The framework was demonstrated on pilot buildings in Sant Cugat, Spain. © 2021 The Authors

AB  - Energy usage and thermal comfort are the pillars of smart buildings. Many research works have been proposed to save energy while maintaining a comfortable thermal condition. However, most of them either make the oversimplified assumption on thermal comfort with unsatisfied comfort performance or deal with the single-zone thermal control only with limited practical impact. A few preliminary pieces of research on multizone control are available, but they fail to keep pace with the latest advancements in the deep-learning-based control techniques. In this article, we investigate the multizone thermal control with optimized energy usage and canonical thermal comfort modeling. We adopt the emerging multiagent deep reinforcement learning techniques and propose to model each zone as an agent. A multiagent framework is established to support the information exchange among the agents and enable intelligent thermal control in the heterogeneous zones. Accordingly, we mathematically formulate a problem to optimize both energy and comfort. A multizone thermal control algorithm (MOCA) is proposed to solve the problem by deriving optimal control policies. We validate the performance of MOCA through simulation in professional TRNSYS, configured based on our real-world laboratory. The results are promising with up to 15.4% energy saving as well as satisfied thermal comfort in different zones. © 2014 IEEE.

AB  - Improving the energy performance of existing buildings is one of the main strategies defined by the European Union to reduce global energy costs. Amongst the actions to be carried out in buildings to achieve this objective is working with passive measures adapted to each type of climate. To assist designers in the process of finding appropriate solutions for each building and location, different tools have been developed and since the implementation of building information modeling (BIM), it has been possible to perform an analysis of a building’s life cycle from an energy perspective and other types of analysis such as a comfort analysis. In the case of Spain, the first BIM environment tool has been implemented that deals with the global analysis of a building’s behavior and serves as an alternative to previous methods characterized by their lack of both flexibility and information offered to designers. This paper evaluates and compares the official Spanish energy performance evaluation tool (Cypetherm) released in 2018 using a case study involving the installation of sunlight control devices as part of a building refurbishment. It is intended to determine how databases and simplifications affect the designer’s decision-making. Additionally, the yielded energy results are complemented by a comfort analysis to explore the impact of these improvements from a users’ wellbeing viewpoint. At the end of the process the yielded results still confirm that the simulation remains far from reality and that simulation tools can indeed influence the decision-making process. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - The construction industry has a huge impact on the environment in terms of noise, water and land pollution, traffic congestion and waste disposal. Another aspect of the construction industry impact on the environment is the increasing energy consumption. According to published research, buildings energy use is expected to increase by 32% by the year 2040. As a result, efforts have been directed toward improving green building awareness and the application of sustainability concepts in the design, construction and building management processes. In this research, using extensive simulations, the integration between Building Information Modeling methodology (BIM) and Building Energy Modeling (BEM) methodologies in order to effectively minimize the overall energy consumption of a residential building in the UAE is investigated by studying several design factors including: building orientation and windows type, size and distribution on the overall building energy consumption. Results show that to increase the modelled building's energy and financial efficiency, recommended changes to the initial design have to be done including changing the distribution of the southern façade and the type of windows glazing used. More specifically, there was a peak energy reduction of: 8% with a 180 degrees building orientation angle, 2% with a window to wall ratio of 15%, and 2% when double glazing windows were used. This work validates that the combination of BIM and BEM allows to enhance the overall building energy consumption efficiency and to further establish the needed sustainability goals through a generated 3D model.

AB  - Electric appliances for cooling and lighting are responsible for most of the increase in electricity consumption in Karachi, Pakistan. This study aims to investigate the impact of passive energy efficiency measures (PEEMs) on the potential reduction of indoor temperature and cooling energy demand of an architectural campus building (ACB) in Karachi, Pakistan. PEEMs focus on the building envelope’s design and construction, which is a key factor of influence on a building’s cooling energy demand. The existing architectural campus building was modeled using the building information modeling (BIM) software Autodesk Revit. Data related to the electricity consumption for cooling, building masses, occupancy conditions, utility bills, energy use intensity, as well as space types, were collected and analyzed to develop a virtual ACB model. The utility bill data were used to calibrate the DesignBuilder and EnergyPlus base case models of the existing ACB. The cooling energy demand was compared with different alternative building envelope compositions applied as PEEMs in the renovation of the existing exemplary ACB. Finally, cooling energy demand reduction potentials and the related potential electricity demand savings were determined. The quantification of the cooling energy demand facilitates the definition of the building’s electricity consumption benchmarks for cooling with specific technologies. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Data-driven green building design in BIM is challenged by the lack of a comprehensive data integration framework with the capabilities of building life-cycle performance data management and application. This paper proposes a performance integrated BIM (P-BIM) framework for building life cycle energy efficiency and environment optimization. A school building is presented as a case study to verify the P-BIM framework and the design optimization workflow established. The results show that the optimization can improve IEQ by 11.5% and reduce LCC by 36.8%. The influences of different envelope constructions on indoor environment, energy consumptions, and costs are also studied. The P-BIM framework and the optimization methodology built on it demonstrate that the methodology developed can expand the application scope of BIM and contribute to data-driven green building design. More application scenarios focusing on the stage of facility management and different sustainability performance will be conducted in P-BIM framework in future works. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Carbon fibre manufacturing is characterized by a high energy demand due to long processing times and energy intensive thermal processes. Since energy flow related information about the carbon fibre production is rare, lacks in detail and ranges widely, the goal of this paper is to increase the transparency of energy flows in the carbon fibre value chain. To this end, the extended energy value stream methodology was modified and applied on a research scale polyacrylonitrilie precursor line and a pilot scale carbon fibre line. The paper takes in a holistic factory understanding when quantifying energy demands and it provides highly-detailed energy related data across the carbon fibre manufacturing process chain. Energy demands are broken down into energy carriers, process steps and peripheral levels of the carbon fibre production system. The results of the paper lay a first valuable step towards a comprehensive life cycle inventory of carbon fibre manufacturing. Furthermore, the high transparency of energy data provides a starting point for future research to increase the energy efficiency of carbon fibre manufacturing. With respect to the high share of the technical building services on the total energy demand, the paper emphasizes the need for an integrated assessment and improvement of the manufacturing process and technical building services. © 2021 The Authors

AB  - In recent years, new technologies, such as Artificial Intelligence, are emerging to improve decision making based on learning. Their use applied to the Architectural, Engineering and Construction (AEC) sector, together with the increased use of Building Information Modeling (BIM) methodology in all phases of a building’s life cycle, is opening up a wide range of opportunities in the sector. At the same time, the need to reduce CO2 emissions in cities is focusing on the energy renovation of existing buildings, thus tackling one of the main causes of these emissions. This paper shows the potentials, constraints and viable solutions of the use of Machine Learning/Artificial Intelligence approaches at the design stage of deep renovation building projects using As-Built BIM models as input to improve the decision-making process towards the uptake of energy efficiency measures. First, existing databases on buildings pathologies have been studied. Second, a Machine Learning based algorithm has been designed as a prototype diagnosis tool. It determines the critical areas to be solved through deep renovation projects by analysing BIM data according to the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC4) standard and proposing the most convenient renovation alternative (based on a catalogue of Energy Conservation Measures). Finally, the proposed diagnosis tool has been applied to a reference test building for different locations. The comparison shows how significant differences appear in the results depending on the situation of the building and the regulatory requirements to which it must be subjected. © 2021 by the authors.

TI  - GIS-based urban energy modelling and energy efficiency scenarios using the energy performance certificate database
PY  - 2021
AU  - Mutani, G.
AU  - Todeschi, V.
AB  - The EU building stock is 97% not energy efficient and the promotion of energy retrofitting strategies is a key way of reducing energy consumptions and greenhouse gas emission. In order to improve the energy performance of buildings, the European Union released the Energy Performance of Buildings and the Energy Efficiency Directives. The certification of the energy performance of a building is a central element of these Directives to monitor and promote energy performance improvements in buildings, with the aim of increasing their energy efficiency level, thereby reducing greenhouse gas emissions. This work evaluates the energy performance of existing residential buildings using the energy performance certificate database and identifies the more effective retrofitting interventions by applying an urban-scale energy model. The novelty of this study is that a new retrofitting database is created to improve the results of a building energy model at urban scale taking into account the real characteristics of the built environment. The here presented GIS-based monthly engineering model is flexible and easily applicable to different contexts, and was used to investigate energy efficiency scenarios by evaluating their effects of city scale. An urban energy atlas was designed for an Italian city, Turin, as a decision-making platform for policy makers and citizens. This energy platform can give information on energy consumption, production and productivity potential, but also on energy retrofitting scenarios. The results of this work show that it is possible to obtain energy savings for space heating of 79,064 MWh/year for the residential buildings connected to the district heating network in the city of Turin; these interventions refer mainly to thermal insulation of buildings envelope with windows replacement and allow a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions of 12,097 tonCO2eq/year. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - Automatically extracting information needed for building energy modeling (BEM) from an IFC BIM can significantly improve efficiency and accuracy in preparing BEM inputs. Second-level space boundaries (SBs) define geometric data required for BEM, but they are often missing or incorrectly defined in IFC models. To address limitations in existing algorithms when generating second-level SBs of complex buildings, this study presents a novel approach that computes geometric and semantic information of second-level SBs using multiple geometry representations of building elements and spaces in an IFC model. Advantages of the approach include: it has relatively loose requirements on the quality of input IFC models; it can process building objects with common curved shapes; it improves computing efficiency when processing large-scale building models by employing three types of geometric representations. The approach was evaluated with two large-scale real-world building models, and the results show that second-level SBs are generated accurately and highly efficiently. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - An energy performance certificate (EPC) provides information on the energy performance of an energy system. The objective of this research aimed at obtaining a predictive model for early detection of thermal power efficiency (TPE) for energy conversion and preservation in buildings. This article expounds a sound and solid nonparametric Bayesian technique known as Gaussian process regression (GPR) approach, based on a set of data collected from different dwellings in an oceanic climate. Firstly, this model introduces the relevance of each predictive variable on energy performance in residential buildings. The second result refers to the statement that we can predict successfully the TPE by using this model. A coefficient of determination equal to 0.9687 was thus established in order to predict the TPE from the observed data, using the GPR approach in combination with the differential evolution (DE) optimiser. The concordance between experimental observed data and the predicted data from the best-proposed novel hybrid DE/GPR-relied model demonstrated here the adequate efficiency of this innovative approach. © 2020, Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Achieving the energy-related and environmental targets for nations and municipalities is largely dependent on the existing built stock. It plays a pivotal role in the accomplishment of these targets through the implementation of energy efficiency and flexibility programs, involving the deployment of distributed energy resource management technologies, refurbishment of building envelopes and upgrading of indoor environmental control equipment. Spatial awareness about urban energy use enables to prioritise the areas where these solutions will be most effective and balanced with the plans for new constructions. Large-scale building energy mapping, however, must cope with heterogeneity of buildings within the built stock, absence of detailed information and multiple sources of uncertainty that stem from the complex and dynamic properties of the phenomenon at a building level. One of the key challenges in the discipline is to account for these uncertainties while maintaining the rational model complexities and data needs. This study, therefore, suggests a parsimonious top-down probabilistic modelling recipe to enable geospatial energy mapping and analysis. Under such modelling principles, an inverse propagation of uncertainties is carried out from the status quo of the built stock. The proposed framework is based on probabilistic sampling with prior parametric univariate density estimation and statistical hypothesis testing. Consolidation with the exogenous influencing factors is facilitated through the measure of statistically significant difference. This approach is exemplified with the data from two sources: the cadastral system and the energy performance certificates registry. A case study developed for Trondheim (Norway) quantified the central tendency and dispersion in the distributions of the simulated bulk total annual energy use by buildings per 1×1km grid cell over the urban territory. The results suggest that best estimates of these values vary between 11MWh·y-1 and 141GWh·y-1 depending on the grid cell. A measure of dispersion in the simulated results is highly correlated with these estimates. Robust handling of uncertainties and the possibility to accommodate a variety of modelling objectives make this approach practical for energy mapping with a flexible spatial resolution that may facilitate numerous applications in energy planning. A collection of methods for univariate density estimation discussed in this study together with the empirical data are accessible through Built Stock Explorer:https://builtstockexplorer.indecol.ntnu.no.

AB  - The findings of recent research signalled increased radon levels following energy retrofitting of dwellings but to date, there have been limited quantitative data to support this observation. A modelling framework was developed that incorporates a dynamic radon entry rate, capturing changes in pressure differentials, to investigate changes in radon concentration following different energy-efficient retrofit measures in naturally-ventilated dwellings. Simulations examined a range of input criteria: dwelling type, air permeabilities, radon flow exponents, pre and post thermal retrofit characteristics, outdoor weather locations and corresponding wind profiles, as well as different ventilation guidelines. A total of 3,780 simulations were carried out. The air permeability of the building had the greatest impact on radon concentration with increases of up to 107%. Non-linear increases were observed arising from the impacts on pressure differentials due to changes in air permeability. The application of representative weather profiles associated with different locations (e.g. coastal, inland) resulted in differences of up to 37%. To a lesser extent, increased indoor temperature due to thermally retrofitting the building fabric, without changes in air permeability, resulted in radon levels increasing by 7%. Additionally, it was shown that the radon flow exponent was not a significant influence on radon concentrations following a retrofit. The addition of ventilation measures means that it is possible to achieve increased airtightness without impacting on the radon concentration. Overall, the simulations provide quantitative information that explains increased airtightness and elevated radon levels, highlighting the potential for radon concentrations to either increase or decrease following an energy retrofit. © 2021 The Authors

AB  - Abstract: The recent adoption of building information modelling (BIM), and the quest to decarbonise our built environment, has impacted several segments of the supply chain, including design and engineering practitioners, prompting the need to redefine the construction personnel positions along with associated skills and competencies. The research informs ways in which practitioners can fully embrace the potential of BIM for energy efficiency to promote sustainable interventions by improving existing training practices and identifying new training requirements as BIM evolves and as practitioners’ ICT (Information and Communications Technology) maturity levels improve. This is achieved by adopting a novel text-mining approach which analyses social media alongside secondary sources of evidence to establish a level of correlation between BIM roles and skills. The use of ontological dependency analysis has helped to understand the degree of correlation of skills with roles as a method to inform training and educational programmes. A key outcome from the research is a semantic web-based mining environment which determines BIM roles and skills, as well as their correlation factor, with an application for energy efficiency. The paper also evidences that (a) construction skills and roles are dynamic in nature and evolve over time, reflecting the digital transformation of the Construction industry, and (b) the importance of socio-organisational aspects in construction skills and related training provision.

TI  - Institutional heat wave analysis by building energy modeling fleet and meter data

AU  - Villa, D.L.
AB  - • Shows detailed methodology for applying building energy model fleets to institutional heat wave analysis. • Demonstrates uncertainty in heat wave analysis based on meter data. • Shows how detailed building energy models used for energy retrofit analysis can be used for heat wave analyses. • The proposed methodology is much more extensible than data-driven or low-order energy models to detailed cross analyses between energy efficiency and resilience for future institutional studies. • Cross benefits between resilience analysis and energy retrofit analyses are demonstrated. Heat waves increase electric demand from buildings which can cause power outages. Modeling can help planners quantify the risk of such events. This study shows how Building Energy Modeling (BEM), meter data, and climate projections can estimate heat wave effect on energy consumption and electric peak load. The methodology assumes that a partial representation of BEM for an entire site of buildings is sufficient to represent the entire site. Two linear regression models of the BEM results are produced: 1) Energy use as a function of heat wave heat content and 2) Peak load as a function of maximum daily temperature. The uncertainty conveyed in meter data is applied to these regressions providing slope and intercept 95% confidence intervals. The methodology was applied using 97 detailed BEM, site weather data, 242 building meters, and NEX-DCP30 down-scaled climate data for an entire institution in Albuquerque, New Mexico. A series of heat waves that vary from 2019 weather to a peak increase of 5.9 °C was derived. The results of the study provided institutional planners with information needed for a site that is presently growing very rapidly. The resulting regression models are also useful for resilience analyses involving probabilistic risk assessments. © 2021 The Author(s)

AB  - The random variation of meteorological parameters affects both building load and energy system design. Although long-term historical meteorological data can reflect this characteristic, a large amount of high-dimensional meteorological data can bring great difficulties to the design process. Therefore, a simplified method of generating meteorological parameters for an uncertainty-based energy system design is proposed in this study. To simplify the meteorological elements, a sensitivity analysis is first carried out based on the maximum information coefficient. Then, combined with the deterministic model and stochastic model of the meteorological parameters, a mixed time-series meteorological model is proposed to reflect the uncertainty. Finally, to generate random meteorological data, based on information entropy theory, Monte Carlo simulation method is adopted and improved by determining the minimum number of simulations. The efficiency and accuracy of this method are verified using a solar heating system design as an example. Results show that the characteristics of uncertainty and time sequence in the meteorological data generated by this method can be well retained. Moreover, the calculation amount can be reduced by 89.3% compared with the original design method. © 2021

Globally accepted Sustainable Development Goals (SDG), specifically SDG 7 (Access to Affordable, Reliable, Sustainable and Modern Energy for All), SDG 9 (Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure), and SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities) stress the responsible utilization of energy in various industries, including construction. The CI uses almost half of the world’s produced energy. Therefore, this research presents insights into the efficient use of energy in the building sector and shows how energy efficiency can be achieved by altering different parameters and components like orientation, materials, glazing, and HVAC systems through a case study of a hospital building in Green Building Studio (GBS). This paper also aims to use the Building Information Modelling (BIM) approach to make environmentally sustainable decisions to reduce energy waste in projects. Initially, beneficial factors of BIM on green buildings were identified in the literature and later ranked, based on expert opinions collected using a set of questionnaires. Average Index was used for data analysis. The identified benefits were validated by conducting energy analyses on a hospital model through 3D BIM. It was concluded that a substantial share of energy cost, carbon dioxide (CO2 ), and electricity can be saved using this approach. It was determined that a quick and sustainable design process, improved energy efficiency, enhanced building performance, and provision of better design alternatives are the key benefits of the adoption of BIM by such projects. A Cronbach’s alpha value of 0.822 was obtained, which further validates the results. The proposed approach may lead future structures to be sustainable and enriches the culture of energy-efficient green buildings. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Building Information Modelling (BIM) is a key enabler to support integration of building data within the buildings life cycle (BLC) and is an important aspect to support a wide range of use cases, related to intelligent automation, navigation, energy efficiency, sustainability and so forth. Open building data faces several challenges related to standardization, data interdependency, data access, and security. In addition to these technical challenges, there remains the barrier among BIM developers who wish to protect their intellectual property, as full 3D BIM development requires expertise and effort. This means that there is often limited availability of building data. However, a Linked Data approach to BIM, combined with a supporting national geospatial identifier infrastructure makes interlinking and controlled sharing of BIM models possible. In Ireland, the Ordnance Survey Ireland (OSi) maintains a substantial data set, called Prime2, which includes not only building GIS data (polygon footprint, geodetic coordinate), but also additional building specific data (e.g. form, function and status). The data set also includes change information, recording when changes took place and who captured and validated those changes. This paper presents the development of a national geospatial identifier infrastructure based on an OSi building ontology that supports capturing OSi building data using Resource Description Framework (RDF). The paper details the different steps required to generate the ontology and publish the data. First, an initial analysis of the data set to generate the ontology is discussed. This includes identification of mappings to existing standards, e.g. GeoSPARQL to handle geometries and PROV-O to handle provenance, to the development of R2RML mappings to generate the RDF and the method for deploying the ontology and the building graphs. This data is then made available dependent on different licensing agreements handled by an access control approach. Methods are then presented to support the interlinking of the authoritative data with other building data standards and data sets using geolocation, followed finally by discussion and future work. © 2020

AB  - Passive design strategies such as orientation, shading, sealing, glazing, and insulation can significantly reduce the necessity of an artificial heating-cooling system, accounting for 40% of total energy usage in the residential building. However, none of the previous studies have quantified the energy reduction and their environmental impacts simultaneously for these passive design parameters to achieve the national standard requirements for house rating. Hence, this study focuses on the use of Building Information Modeling (BIM-Autodesk Revit), energy rating tool (FirstRate5), and BIM-enabled life cycle assessment (LCA-Tally) to quantify, compare, and improve the building design options to reduce carbon footprint and energy consumptions in residential dwellings. Sensitivity analysis has been performed with the @Risk Palisade decision tool for optimizing operational energy efficiency. The sensitivity indices show the ceiling (0.84–0.96) and the wall (0.22–0.37) are the most influential predictors for passive design strategies to reduce energy consumption. A moderate correlation exists with windows, floors, and orientations (0.13–0.29), where the relationship with eave projection, air infiltrations is relatively weak. BIM has been used as a platform of interconnectivity between optimized operational energy of @Risk optimizer and consequent embodied phases. A comparative study of insulation performance identifies that 95% of the ceiling's total operational energy consumption can be minimized using R3 rather than R6 of the national thermal code. For the wall, 90% of energy minimization can occur using R2 rather than R4 of the national thermal code. The study reveals that while insulation is only 1% of the total building mass, and the corresponding carbon footprint and primary energy demand are 4% and 7%, respectively, LCA explains a significant amount of energy, about 76% reduction at its operational stage. In this paper, an evidence-based analytical framework provides a BIM-based optimization platform to validate and justify the impact categories of environment-friendly, energy-efficient design of houses. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Retrofitting energy-inefficient external walls would improve the energy performance of building envelope by utilizing new insulation materials to decrease heat transfer. However, previous researches mainly based on environmental and economic considerations are still partial and could hardly provide a holistic perspective for the optimal selection of external walls retrofit techniques. To address this problem, this paper proposes a novel heterogeneous multi-criteria group decision-making (MCGDM) framework in which the ratings of schemes are described with real numbers and linguistic variables and the weights of criteria are unknown. Firstly, an evaluation index system is established covering criteria of thermal insulation property, technique, durability, and economic efficiency. Secondly, building information modeling (BIM) is utilized to determine multiple retrofit schemes and derive the heat transfer coefficient. Thirdly, after heterogeneous evaluation values are unified, a combined weighting approach is developed based on best worst method (BWM) and the similarity method before fuzzy VlseKriterijumska Optimizacija I Kompromisno Resenje (VIKOR) method is applied to rank the alternatives. Fourthly, the applicability of the proposed framework is demonstrated by a case study of the external wall retrofit scheme selection in Beijing, which reveals that extruded polystyrene (XPS) and expanded polystyrene (EPS) insulation schemes are the compromise choices with aggregating index Qk of 0.0032 and 0.0967 respectively, while rock wool insulation scheme is the last option with Qk of 0.7182. The stability of ranking results is proved with the changing weight of maximum group utility, and the effectiveness of the proposed framework is verified by a comparative analysis. This study can facilitate the implementation of building envelope retrofit by providing useful guidance for selection of external wall retrofit schemes. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Ten questions concerning co-simulation for performance prediction of advanced building envelopes

AB  - Advanced building envelopes (ABEs) are innovative integrated systems that aim to increase the sustainability of buildings by providing flexible and efficient energy management solutions while safeguarding healthy and comfortable indoor environments. These building envelopes operate at the cross-section of architecture, engineering and data science, often involving transient multi-physical parameters and advanced material properties. The development of ABEs has increasingly relied on building performance simulation (BPS) tools to improve the understanding and management of their complex interrelationships. However, this complexity has sometimes shown to constitute barriers for their real-world implementation, in part caused by the limitations of monolithic legacy BPS tools. One of the most promising alternatives to overcoming these difficulties has been to use co-simulation. Co-simulation allows modelers to use multiple sub-models and link them to enable simultaneous data exchange during simulation runtime. This approach provides added possibilities for implementing advanced control strategies, integrating innovative data-driven inputs, and creating collaborative interdisciplinary and evolutive workflows for building envelopes at different stages and scales in projects. This article provides a critical overview of the possibilities that co-simulation approaches offer to improve performance assessments of advanced building envelopes. This article also presents current barriers to co-simulation and discusses critical elements to overcome them. Ongoing trends in BPS and information and communication technologies are highlighted, emphasizing how they transform the field and create new opportunities for modelers working in research and industry. © 2021 The Authors

TI  - Splitting measurements of the total heat demand in a hotel into domestic hot water and space heating heat use

AB  - To achieve more efficient energy use in buildings, space heating (SH) and domestic hot water (DHW) heat use should be analysed separately. Unfortunately, in many buildings, the heat meters measure the total heat use only, typically not divided into SH and DHW. This article presented a method for splitting the total heat use into the SH and the DHW. The splitting follows the assumption that the outdoor temperature is the main parameter explaining the hourly SH heat use, while the hourly DHW heat use is not influenced by this parameter. In the article, the modelled SH heat use was extracted from the total heat use based on the energy signature curve and the singular spectrum analysis. Thereafter, from the residuals between the modelled SH heat use and the total heat use, the DHW heat use was identified. The application of the method for the hotel in Norway showed that restored values represented the trends of the measured SH and DHW heat use well. The coefficient of determination (R2) for the modelled SH heat use was 0.97, and 0.76 for DHW. The methodology is useful for obtaining valuable information for monitoring and improving the energy performance of SH and DHW systems. © 2020 The Author(s)

AB  - The operational management and strategic interventions for energy efficiency (EE) of facilities could be optimised if interventions and decision-making processes are well integrated. Hence, this study developed a conceptual dual model for building energy performance (BEP) as a composite model based on prior theories. The theoretical study variables were interventions (technical and operational) and decision-making (management) factors (manifest variables) derived from an extensive literature review. Likewise, the constructs (latent variables) were the aggregated data of the intervention/decision-making evident factors used in the composite scale model. These constructs define the identifiable EE (management) manifest factors and classify them for standardised EE management practices. This paper describes the effects and the causal relationship between constructs derived from these factors that impact BEP via the composite scale model. An online self-administered questionnaire was used in gathering information from the occupants of selected office buildings in two countries (Nigeria and the UK). Structural equation modelling was engaged in evaluating the structure of the composite scale model that serves as a merger of isolated critical factors that affect BEP improvement. The model has four parts: the strategic driver, management policy, operational and building energy performance constructs as distinct sub-models. The results of the model evaluation reveal that the collected data fit the hypothesised dual model and have good fits. The models are not significantly different; they help investigate the fundamental relationship between the constructs. The result also reveals a strong positive correlation of management policy with strategic drivers for EE; strategic drivers with the use of building energy performance model; and management policy with operational EE practices. Path evaluation shown on the dual model specified the hypothesised causal relationship amongst constructs and strategic driver as the only significant positive mediator. Furthermore, the study integrates interventions and decision-making in a new dual model for improving BEP for diagnostic and solution purposes. Facility managers and owners could use the dual model as a strategic and tactical decision-making implement in managing low-carbon office BEP. © 2021, Crown.

AB  - Highly energy efficient (HEE) buildings require a whole-system approach to building design. Scholars have suggested many tools, techniques, and processes to address the cross-disciplinary complexities of such an approach, but how these elements might be best combined to lead to better project outcomes is yet unknown. To address this, we surveyed architects associated with 33 AIA-COTE award-winning projects on the social, organizational, and technological elements of whole-system design (WSD) practices. We then used fuzzy sets-qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) to analyze the interdependencies among those elements. We found three distinct pathways for the design and construction of HEE buildings: information-driven, process-driven, or organization-driven. We also found that HEE buildings share some conditions for success, including having shared goals, owners engagement in the design process, and frequent and participatory interorganizational meetings. Our findings can help practitioners strategize and make decisions on incorporating WSD elements associated with their project types. Moreover, these results provide a launchpad for scholars to investigate complementarities among elements facilitating the design and construction process of HEE projects. © 2020 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB  - Increasing global building energy demand, with the related economic and environmental impact, upsurges the need for the design of reliable energy demand forecast models. This work presents kCNN-LSTM, a deep learning framework that operates on the energy consumption data recorded at predefined intervals to provide accurate building energy consumption forecasts. kCNN-LSTM employs (i) k−means clustering – to perform cluster analysis to understand the energy consumption pattern/trend; (ii) Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) – to extract complex features with non-linear interactions that affect energy consumption; and (iii) Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks – to handle long-term dependencies through modeling temporal information in the time series data. The efficiency and applicability of kCNN-LSTM were demonstrated using a real time building energy consumption data acquired from a four-storeyed building in IIT-Bombay, India. The performance of kCNN-LSTM was compared with the k-means variant of the state-of-the-art energy demand forecast models in terms of well-known quality metrics. It is also observed that the accurate energy demand forecast provided by kCNN-LSTM due to its ability to learn the spatio-temporal dependencies in the energy consumption data makes it a suitable deep learning model for energy consumption forecast problems. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Incoming solar radiation is a key factor influencing solar architecture design. It determines the thermal and optical regime of the building envelope and affects the solar heat and light transfer between the indoors and outdoors. Computational analysis is an essential tool in solar architecture design. Usually, an entire year's weather data in a conventional weather file can be imported into such computational analyses. Solar irradiance data used in a conventional solar architecture design analytics are broadband (the total of UV, VIS, and NIR); however, these three components play different roles in building energy efficiency. So, analyzing individual solar components separately can be desirable. This research is to develop estimation models of the VIS and NIR components that can be captured efficiently from readily available datasets collected from the ground weather stations; such a model can then be conveniently implemented into current solar architecture design and research. We explored and tested classification-based modeling methods for decomposing hourly broadband global horizontal solar irradiance data in conventional weather files into hourly global horizontal solar VIS and NIR components. Furthermore, a workflow of how to implement these models in solar architecture design and analysis has been developed and discussed herein. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Improved model and optimization for the energy performance of chiller system with diverse component staging
PY  - 2021
AU  - Ho, W.T.
AU  - Yu, F.W.
AB  - Accurate data-driven models are required to optimize the energy performance of chiller systems with individual configurations and control strategies. This study develops stepwise regression models at successive time steps to estimate accurately the coefficient of performance (COP) of a system with diverse component staging. Comprehensive trend logging data were collected at 15-min intervals year-round for a system with five chillers of two capacities. Data at two successive time points were compiled into 19 input variables relating to the components’ operating statuses, load sharing variation, temperature-related and flow-related variables and weather conditions. Stepwise regression with the Akaike information criterion was performed to select the predictor variables and time points giving the highest achievable coefficient of determination R2. The developed system COP models with different numbers of operating chillers and multiple time points has an increased R2 of 0.75–0.94 compared with 0.37–0.89 for a conventional model with the chiller part load ratio (PLR) only. The model coefficients help prioritize variables to be optimized. The L-BFGS-B optimization algorithm with operating constraints was applied to predict the maximum system COP for the system operating for the cooling load profile of an educational building. A reduction of 9.14–16.67% was estimated in the annual electricity consumption when compared with the existing operation. The optimal control involves implementing pair-up operation of chillers, pumps and cooling towers, and resetting the temperature of water leaving the condensers at specific ranges based on the number of operating chillers. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Utilising open geospatial data to refine weather variables for building energy performance evaluation—incident solar radiation and wind-driven infiltration modelling
PY  - 2021
AU  - Skeie, K.

AB  - In building thermal energy characterisation, the relevance of proper modelling of the effects caused by solar radiation, temperature and wind is seen as a critical factor. Open geospatial datasets are growing in diversity, easing access to meteorological data and other relevant information that can be used for building energy modelling. However, the application of geospatial techniques combining multiple open datasets is not yet common in the often scripted workflows of data-driven building thermal performance characterisation. We present a method for processing time-series from climate reanalysis and satellite-derived solar irradiance services, by implementing land-use, and elevation raster maps served in an elevation profile web-service. The article describes a methodology to: (1) adapt gridded weather data to four case-building sites in Europe; (2) calculate the incident solar radiation on the building facades; (3) estimate wind and temperature-dependent infiltration using a single-zone infiltration model and (4) including separating and evaluating the sheltering effect of buildings and trees in the vicinity, based on building footprints. Calculations of solar radiation, surface wind and air infiltration potential are done using validated models published in the scientific literature. We found that using scripting tools to automate geoprocessing tasks is widespread, and implementing such techniques in conjunction with an elevation profile web service made it possible to utilise information from open geospatial data surrounding a building site effectively. We expect that the modelling approach could be further improved, including diffuse-shading methods and evaluating other wind shelter methods for urban settings. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - In recent years, advanced information technologies, such as deep learning and big data, have been actively applied in building energy management systems to improve energy efficiency. Various studies have been conducted on the prediction of renewable energy performance using machine learning techniques. In this study, a recurrent neural network (RNN) was utilized in predicting photovoltaic (PV) power generation. An RNN is an artificial neural network in which the connection between units is composed of a cyclic structure that can reflect the characteristics of time series. Therefore, to eventually incorporate a model predictive control technique for energy demand and supply matching, this study uses previously measured weather data and PV power generation data to predict the future PV power generation. Various optimization processes, such as normalization, classification of learning data, and setting of layer options, are performed to create a predictive model. Furthermore, 500 hidden neurons and 1 and 3 hidden layers are created and compared. The initial learning rate for both single and multiple-layer options was set to 0.05. As a result, the coefficient of variation of the root mean squared error, Cv(RMSE), which is a statistical index to assess the overall accuracy of the predicted values, was 13.8 % for a single layer and 13.2 % for a multiple-layer long short term memory model. Although no significant difference was observed between the two models, the multiple-layer model showed a slightly reduced error rate than the single-layer model, and the accurate prediction was confirmed to be achievable. Based on this study, a stable energy supply system can be established through linkage with energy storage control by predicting the amount of energy production through renewable energy sources and the amount of energy demand at urban scale. © 2021, The Korean Society of Mechanical Engineers and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Building energy assessment is essential to accomplish the sustainable energy targets of new and present buildings. Retrofitting of the existing buildings by assessing them through energy models is the most prominent method. Studies revealed that there is still blank information about the building stocks, and these affect the valuation of building energy efficiency policies. Literature also recommends that the existing energy models are too complex and unreliable to predict the energy use. Reliability of such energy models would improve through a better alignment of the input parameters and the model assumptions. The authors hypothesized that the reliability of models would be improved through identification of the most relevant energy use parameters for the building stocks in different regions and models. One of the most commonly accepted methods for detecting the most dominant input parameters is sensitivity analysis, though its shortcomings include the need for a large number of data samples and long computing time. In this research, the Energy, Carbon, and Cost Assessment for Buildings Stocks (ECCABS) model is adopted to identify the most important parameters of the presented model. The research team uses the model that has been validated by studies conducted for the UK building stock. Moreover, by assessing the feasibility study with the stepwise regression to identify the significant input parameters have been discussed.

AB  - Nowadays, the building industry tends to produce energy-efficient buildings, which account for a greater percentage of embodied energy over their life cycle. Life cycle assessment (LCA) is used as a method to assess the environmental impact of a building during its lifetime, and Building Information Modeling (BIM) includes the analysis of the building's environmental performance. It is necessary to provide a framework to optimize building Life cycle energy, taking into account different aspects of decision-making. The purpose of this research is to combine a multi-objective optimization algorithm with BIM and LCA to determine the trade-off between embodied and operation energy with a focus on renewable energy use. To achieve this objective, full LCA of exterior shell materials with the prefabricated focus was measured. Also, the amount of embodied energy and energy produced by the solar panel as a renewable energy production system was calculated in it. In the next step, parametric simulation in Grasshopper was done for operation energy estimation, and Hypervolume Estimation Algorithm for Multi-objective Optimization (HypE) was used. Then, to retrieve the data quickly, all the optimal solutions were added to the BIM model with a plugin. The results not only show that there has been an optimal range with maximizing embodied energy to reduce the operation energy, which can be extracted by the proposed framework. But also it represents a reduction of about 65% in the whole life cycle energy of the building compared to the usual state of the construction industry in Iran. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The European Union has identified buildings as the most promising targets for improving energy efficiency and has quantified a significant energy saving potential associated with the refurbishment of a building's envelope and the installation of new technologies. The key objective of monitoring and modelling energy profiles in buildings is to provide the necessary background on energy consumption and to allow informed decisions to be made. The modelling usually starts with the integration of energy into the activity flow charts, which is the basis for the decisions on setting up the structure of energy cost centres. This paper evaluates the capabilities of data envelopment analysis in combination with energy cost centre based modelling for the electricity consumption analysis of a selected group of elementary schools and kindergartens. The electricity consumption data was obtained in cooperation with a local energy agency, which was acting as the energy manager for the selected group of buildings. The results confirmed the potential of combining the data envelopment analysis and the energy cost centre based modelling in order to properly identify the schools having the potential for energy efficiency improvements. Additionally, the combination of results obtained with the data envelopment analysis and the contextual parameters hidden in the structure of energy cost centres provides additional and valuable information for the energy manager and helps him with proper benchmarking of the analysed energy management practices. The results encouraged the energy manager to look for concrete opportunities to improve the energy efficiency and revealed that electricity savings of up to 14% could be achieved with better energy management in the selected group of buildings. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The building sector is responsible for 32% of global energy consumption and 19% of all energy-related greenhouse gas emissions. The urgent requirement for energy conservation and greenhouse gas emission reduction in the building sector has been recognised at the highest level of governments around the world. One potential solution, which has yet to be critically considered, is the application of Building Information Modeling (BIM) to overcome building energy performance gap (BEPG), defined as the discrepancy between the designed and actual energy consumption in buildings. This study performs a systematic and comprehensive literature review to identify the specific causes of the BEPG, and then analyses the application of BIM for addressing the BEPG. A life-cycle BIM engaged framework was developed, including the function of “information exchange”, “design review”, “energy-related quality control”, “life-cycle commissioning”, and “real-time operation and maintenance management”. It is expected that the proposed framework will assist researchers and practitioners better understand application of BIM to systematically improve building energy performance. © 2020

AB  - This study aims to develop a methodology for the selection of sustainable building materials for the reduction of embodied and operational energy for a complex infrastructuretransportation project, i.e., elevated metro rail station of Ahmedabad, India by applicationof building information modelling (BIM) and factor comparison method (FCM). Evaluation ofthe alternative building materials and designs to obtain the best energy efficiency has beencarried out using Revit Architecture 2018 and Green Building Studio. The achieved averageembodied energy savings is about 73%, which is by the suggested alternative materialsinstead of existing ones. By application of FCM, which is a multi-criteria decision making(MCDM) technique, it has been observed that the polished Kota-stone flooring, stone-floor-tilecladding, toughened fibre-glass ceiling and insulated fibre-glass door appear to be the mostfeasible sustainable material for flooring, wall cladding, ceiling, openings and fenestrations forthe design of the metro rail station box in Ahmedabad, India. This study contributes significantknowledge in the field by highlighting the application of BIM as a tool for sustainabledevelopment and recommends a few alternate building materials and sustainable designswhich would result in the reduction of energy usage for the metro-rail-station and otherbuilding structures leading to a sustainable future © Penerbit Universiti Sains Malaysia, 2021.

AU  - Taher, A.H.

AB  - The recent accelerated development of the information management process has assisted to provide further technical development in the construction industry. In order to achieve the best sustainable design, it is critical to examine the design of construction projects and consider all potential alternatives. This problem may become very difficult when the choice of alternative depends on the assessment of a number of design related criteria. Hence, there is a need for better tools and increased use of technology to improve the selection of suitable alternative. The use of Building Information Modeling (BIM) and Value Engineering (VE) can improve sustainable design even further. In addition, the use of Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) is a fundamental approach to decision making. This paper presents a framework integrating BIM with VE to improve sustainable design by creating a model designed to select the best alternative with several criteria. This model is based on the development of a 5 D BIM model, studying the energy efficiency of building design. Also, assess the relative environmental impacts of building materials. Finally, Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is considered through the LEED rating system according to ISO 14040 standards. The results show that the proposed model has the potential to improve the study of VE job plan, and the importance of the model in evaluating and selecting the most appropriate alternative design. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Systematic and continuous monitoring and management of the energy consumption of buildings are important for estimating building energy efficiency, and ultimately aim to cope with climate change and establish effective policies for environment, and energy supply and demand policies. Globally, buildings consume 36% of total energy and account for 39% of carbon dioxide emissions. The purpose of this study is to generate threedimensional thermo-spatial building models with photogrammetric technique using drone TIR (Thermal Infrared) images to measure the temperature emitted from a building, that is essential for the building energy rating system. The aerial triangulation was performed with both optical and TIR images taken from the sensor mounted on the drone, and the accuracy of the models was analyzed. In addition, the thermo-spatial models of temperature distribution of the buildings in three-dimension were visualized. Although shape of the objects 3D building modeling is relatively inaccurate as the spatial and radiometric resolution of the TIR images are lower than that of optical images, TIR imagery could be used effectively to measure the thermal energy of the buildings based on spatial information. This paper could be meaningful to present extension of photogrammetry to various application. The energy consumption could be quantitatively estimated using the temperature emitted from the individual buildings that eventually would be uses as essential information for building energy efficiency rating system. © 2021 Korean Society of Surveying.

TI  - Stability analysis of long-span prestressed steel structure of elevated station using edge computing
PY  - 2021
AU  - Luo, L.
AB  - The purpose is to improve the efficiency and accuracy of stability analysis of long-span prestressed steel structure of viaduct, and solve the problem of poor visualization and parameterization of traditional prestressed steel structure stability analysis. The application of edge computing technology in the stability analysis of structural steel is explored. As an effective supplement to cloud computing, edge computing is a technology for data analysis and processing at the near end of information generation. Because of its remarkable advantages in agility and real-time, it is widely used in typical industry application scenarios such as predictive maintenance, energy efficiency management and intelligent manufacturing, but its use in the field of building construction is little known. Therefore, based on the method of steel structure joint stability judgment and the technical characteristics of building information modeling (BIM) and edge computing, a BIM and edge computing long-span prestressed steel structure stability analysis system composed of three-layer structure of data acquisition layer, edge computing layer and comprehensive scheduling layer is composed. With the engineering construction project of the actual elevated station as the research object, the stable bearing capacity of the steel structure is solved through the automatic information collection, calculation and analysis process of the system, and the practical application process of the system is described. It effectively confirms the multiple advantages of edge computing and BIM technology in the stability analysis of prestressed steel structures compared with traditional analysis methods in visualization, plotting and real-time, and expands the possibility of the application of edge computing technology in the field of building construction. It is concluded that the stability analysis process of long-span prestressed steel structure based on edge computing is efficient and convenient, and has strong practicability and application. Meanwhile, it is of great significance to solve the problem of safety collaborative management in steel structure construction, improve the ability of project management and construction efficiency, and finally ensure the smooth progress of the project. © 2021, The Author(s) under exclusive licence to The Society for Reliability Engineering, Quality and Operations Management (SREQOM), India and The Division of Operation and Maintenance, Lulea University of Technology, Sweden.

TI  - A two-stage recursive ray tracing algorithm to automatically identify external building objects in building information models

AB  - The internal or external attribute of building information modeling (BIM) objects is vital information for many BIM-based engineering analyses such as building energy analysis and cost estimation. Unfortunately, such information is often inaccurate, incomplete, or missing entirely in most BIM models. Manually checking, correcting, or inputting this data for large-scale BIM models can be time-consuming, laborious, and error-prone. This study proposes a two-stage ray tracing algorithm to automatically identify external BIM objects, based on the idea that external objects of a building can be viewed from somewhere outside the building. The first-stage ray tracing samples viewpoints from the six faces of an offset axis-aligned bounding box (AABB) of the building and emits a ray for each viewpoint to detect relevant external objects. The second-stage ray tracing recursively searches for any remaining external objects from the view of the external objects that have been detected in the previous round of ray tracing. Both stages are carefully designed for efficiency. Furthermore, a two-tier AABB tree is introduced to spatially index building objects on both model and object levels to accelerate relevant geometry operations. The proposed algorithm is validated with one synthetic and two large-scale real-world building models. The results show that all the external objects in the three models are accurately and efficiently identified, and the two-tier spatial indexing and other acceleration techniques improve the algorithm's efficiency significantly. © 2021 Computer-Aided Civil and Infrastructure Engineering

AB  - Recent technology development and penetration of advanced metering infrastructure (AMI), advanced building control systems, and the internet-of-things (IoT) in the built environment are providing detailed information on building operation, performance, and user's comfort and behavior. Building owners can obtain a wide range of energy consumption details at various levels of time granularity to augment their decisions as they manage the building operation and interact with the grid. AMI data are providing a new level of detail and visibility that may enhance building services and assets in the smart grid domain and make buildings inch closer to becoming a grid-interactive energy efficient buildings (GEB). While utility-installed AMI typically records energy consumption at a 15, 30, or 60-minute resolution, building-owner-installed metering can record energy consumption at one-minute or sub-minute time scales, providing information about how much the energy consumption varies from one sub-minute to the other (i.e. variability) at a finer time resolutions than typically available from AMI. This paper examines one-minute building load profile data sets and presents a framework to study, define, extract, quantify and analyze variability in buildings' load profiles. The discussion of variability and its analysis is based on a case study of an actual sub-minute time-resolution data set, collected in 2019, for two buildings in a Midwest state in the USA. The result shows that for the case studies, the level of variability in an end-use category is not simply proportional to its consumption. Furthermore, distinct and predictable daily variability patterns emerge in end-use load categories. This information is useful for a host of applications including prediction, forecasting, and modeling. © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - The objective of the undertaken study is to assess the application of Building Information Modeling (BIM) and evaluate the quality of information on construction projects. The paper also focuses on examining the design information quality on construction projects by applying BIM based on perceived variables, for instance, improve workflow, improve collaboration, design visualization, lower cost, environmental impact analysis, and variations. The first objective was to evaluate the impact of building information modeling on perceived variables such as improve workflow, improve collaboration, design visualization, lower cost, environmental impact analysis, and variations. We also evaluated the impact of these six constitutes of BIM, for instance, improve workflow, improve collaboration, design visualization, lower cost, environmental impact analysis, and variations on reducing design information problem. Finally, we have evaluated the mediating impact of improve workflow, improve collaboration, design visualization, lower cost, environmental impact analysis, and variations between building information modeling and reducing design information problems. In the last, we also examined the impact of BIM on reducing design information problems. In this context, the closed-ended five-point Likert scale adapted questionnaire was distributed among construction professionals, and data were analyzed through structural equation modeling and multivariate techniques using statistical software. The findings demonstrated that BIM has a significant & positive impact on its six constitutes. Additionally, we examined these constitutes such as improve workflow, improve collaboration, design visualization, lower cost, environmental impact analysis, and variations have a significant impact on reducing design information problems. The results also significantly contributed to the fact that BIM has a significant impact on reducing design information problems, ultimately playing a pivotal role in assessing design information quality on projects. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Thermography is an efficient way of detecting the thermal problems of the roof as a major part of a building’s energy dissipation. Thermal images have a low spatial resolution, making it a challenge to produce a three-dimensional thermal model using aerial images. This paper proposes a combination of thermal and visible point clouds to generate a higher-resolution thermal point cloud from roofs of buildings. For this purpose, after obtaining the internal orientation parameters through camera calibration, visible and thermal point clouds were generated and then registered to each other using ground control points. The roofs of buildings were then extracted from the visible point cloud in four steps. First ground points were removed using cloth simulation filter (CSF), and then vegetation points were eliminated by applying entropy and red-green-blue vegetation index (RGBVI). Geometric features and a segmentation step were considered to filter roofs from other parts. Finally, by combining visible and thermal point clouds, the generated point had a high spatial resolution along with thermal information. In the achieved results, the thermal camera calibration was performed with an accuracy of 0.31 pixels, and the thermal and visible point clouds were registered with an absolute distance of < 0.3 m. The experimental results showed an accuracy of 18 cm for automated extraction of building roofs and 0.6 pixel for production of a high-resolution thermal point cloud, which was five times the density of the primary thermal point cloud and free from distortions. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Purpose: In developing countries, such as Brazil, the construction sector is consistently focused on the construction of new buildings, and there is no dissemination of the preservation, restoration and maintenance of historic buildings. Idle buildings, due to the use and lack of maintenance, present pathological manifestations, such as moisture problems that compromise specially their thermal and energy performance. With this in mind, the purpose of this work is to create a digital model using terrestrial photogrammetry and suggest retrofit interventions based on computer simulation to improve the thermal and energy performance of a historical building. Design/methodology/approach: The proposed methodology combined terrestrial photogrammetry using common smartphones and commercial software for historical buildings with building information modeling (historic building information modeling (HBIM)) and building energy modeling (BEM). The approach follows five steps: planning, site visit, data processing, data modeling and results. Also, as a case study, the School of Architecture and Urbanism of the Fluminense Federal University, built in 1888, was chosen to validate the approach. Findings: A digital map of pathological manifestations in the HBIM model was developed, and interventions considering the application of expanded polystyrene in the envelope to reduce energy consumption were outlined. From the synergy between HBIM and BEM, it was concluded that the information modeled using photogrammetry was fundamental to create the energy model, and simulations were needed to optimize the possible solutions in terms of energy consumption. Originality/value: Firstly, the work proposes a reasonable methodology to be applied in development countries without sophisticated technologies, but with acceptable precision for the study purpose. Secondly, the presented study shows that the use of HBIM for energy modeling proved to be useful to simulate possible solutions that optimize the thermal and energy performance. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Purpose: The relatively low capital cost and contributions to mitigating global warming have favoured the continuous construction and operation of nuclear power plants (NPPs) across the world. One critical phase in the operation of nuclear plants for ensuring the safety and security of radioactive products and by-products is decommissioning. With the advent of digital twinning in the building information modelling (BIM) methodology, efficiency and safety can be improved from context-focus access to regulations pertaining to demolition of structures and the cleaning-up of radioactivity inherent in nuclear stations. The purpose of this study, therefore, is to propose a BIM-driven framework to achieve a more regulation-aware and safer decommissioning of nuclear power plants. Design/methodology/approach: The framework considers task requirements, and landscape and environmental factors in modelling demolition scenarios that characterise decommissioning processes. The framework integrates decommissioning rules/regulations in a BIM linked non-structured query system to model items and decommissioning tasks, which are implemented based on context-focussed retrieval of decommissioning rules and regulations. The concept’s efficacy is demonstrated using example cases of digitalised NPPs. Findings: This approach contributes to enhancing improvements in nuclear plant decommissioning with potential for appropriate activity sequencing, risk reduction and ensuring safety. Originality/value: A BIM-driven framework hinged on querying non-structured databases to provide context-focussed access to nuclear rules and regulations and to aiding decommissioning is new. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Traditionally, building energy model is created in isolation from the architectural building information model and energy analyses have relied on a single analysis tool. The building energy model can be generated more quickly by leveraging existing data from the BIM. The impacts of energy consumption are significant in the building usage phase, which can last several decades. Due to the large share of the final energy consumption in the building sector, accurate analysis of thermal and cooling loads of a building and the efforts to reduce energy losses represent an effective way to reduce energy consumption. Therefore, it is essential to analyze the building energy performance in the design phase, which is when critical decisions are made. This study aims to investigate the impact of the building components and construction materials on building energy efficiency using Building Information Modeling (BIM) technology in a mild climate zone. After reviewing the proposed designs, the main building form was chosen for energy modeling and analysis. Then, building energy consumption analysis was performed based on the basic parameters of the building energy model. Eventually, the most optimal mode was selected by examining different energy consumption forms. This study showed that the building HVAC system always had the largest share of energy consumption. Finally, the results of parametric studies on alternative schemes of energy use intensity optimization showed that 22.59 % savings could be achieved as compared to the base building model in a 30-year time horizon. © 2021 The Author(s).

AB  - Buildings are responsible for several negative impacts on the environment, most of them related to nonrenewable energy consumption, increasing the concern regarding buildings energy efficiency. In this context, computer software has been used to estimate the energy needs of the built environment, and the Building Information Modelling (BIM) methodology can be used to simplify this process. This study aims to validate a BIM-based framework to streamline the energy analysis of Portuguese buildings, based on the method of the national regulation for the thermal performance of residential buildings. Currently, designers need to spend considerable time assessing all the building characteristics and performing the mandatory calculations for energy performance analysis. It is also intended to link the results of the energy simulation with a Building Sustainability Assessment method—SBToolPT-H. The purpose is to demonstrate how it is possible to benefit from this approach to simultaneously improve building sustainability during the design stage. To do so, different case studies were modelled in Autodesk Revit and exported to a BIM energy tool to perform energy simulation analysis. The results were validated against the official assessment method of the Portuguese thermal regulation and were successfully used to assess the SBToolPT-H energy efficiency category. The research outcomes provide design teams with a reliable BIM-based framework to improve building energy performance and to develop thermal projects while enhancing building sustainability. It also increases the knowledge about the integration of sustainability assessment in the BIM environment, providing new insights for complete integration. © 2021 by the authors.

TI  - IoT-BIM-based digital transformation in facilities management: a conceptual model
PY  - 2021
AU  - Dahanayake, K.C.
AU  - Sumanarathna, N.
AB  - Purpose: This paper aims to explore the opportunities of integrating internet of things (IoT) with building information modelling (BIM) to support the digital transformation of facilities management (FM). In this regard, a conceptual framework is proposed to implement IoT-BIM-based smart FM in buildings. Design/methodology/approach: A semi-systematic literature review was conducted to examine the opportunities of integrating IoT-BIM-based smart FM. Findings: BIM models are seldom used during the operations stage, and the comprehensive digital information developed during the design and construction stage is not efficiently used throughout the building’s life cycle. Therefore, this paper suggests that IoT-BIM can be effectively integrated into six FM functions, namely, energy management, operations and maintenance management, space management, FM project management, emergency management and quality management. IoT-BIM provides a beneficial platform for the digital transformation in FM, optimising the effectiveness and efficiency of buildings. Originality/value: As a recent approach, the integration of BIM with IoT has created a new direction for moving from traditional FM to digitalise smart FM. However, the adaptation of IoT-BIM concept, particularly for FM, is yet to be explored. Hence, this paper contributes to the IoT-BIM research in the FM domain by highlighting six IoT-BIM-based smart FM for digital transformation in FM. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - The timing of individual neuronal spikes is essential for biological brains to make fast responses to sensory stimuli. However, conventional artificial neural networks lack the intrinsic temporal coding ability present in biological networks. We propose a spiking neural network model that encodes information in the relative timing of individual spikes. In classification tasks, the output of the network is indicated by the first neuron to spike in the output layer. This temporal coding scheme allows the supervised training of the network with backpropagation, using locally exact derivatives of the postsynaptic spike times with respect to presynaptic spike times. The network operates using a biologically plausible synaptic transfer function. In addition, we use trainable pulses that provide bias, add flexibility during training, and exploit the decayed part of the synaptic function. We show that such networks can be successfully trained on multiple data sets encoded in time, including MNIST. Our model outperforms comparable spiking models on MNIST and achieves similar quality to fully connected conventional networks with the same architecture. The spiking network spontaneously discovers two operating modes, mirroring the accuracy-speed tradeoff observed in human decision-making: a highly accurate but slow regime, and a fast but slightly lower accuracy regime. These results demonstrate the computational power of spiking networks with biological characteristics that encode information in the timing of individual neurons. By studying temporal coding in spiking networks, we aim to create building blocks toward energy-efficient, state-based biologically inspired neural architectures. We provide open-source code for the model. CCBY

TI  - Design and Control Analysis of an Automatic Active Domestic Solar Water Heating System
PY  - 2021
AU  - Nguimdo, L.A.
AU  - Funue, A.N.
AB  - Solar water heating technology has become one of the most attractive methods of heating water in residential and public buildings with numerous benefits. This study presents the design technique for an automatic active domestic solar water heating system (ADSWHS) to satisfy the hot water demand for a residence in Wum (10.43°E, 6.23° N) with a daily hot water demand of 500 litres supplied at 70oC, using flat plate solar collectors and an arduino microcontroller. The solar data used in this analysis were obtained from Photovoltaic Geographical Information System (PVGIS) and the method used is the active direct roof mounted solar water heating. The system design process consist of evaluating the optimum collector tilt angle, the thermal analysis of the flat plate collector and hot water storage tank and finally modelling a low cost automatic controller for the system using a microcontroller in the Proteus software. The optimum annual average solar radiation on the tilted solar collector was obtained following the calculation of the conversion ratios of the direct, diffuse and reflected radiations. At annual time scale, the optimum tilt angle (β) that maximizes the collected radiation was 11o and the corresponding optimum average irradiance of 432 W/m2 was obtained. The analytical results presented for the performance of the heater indicate that the system operates at an annual thermal efficiency of 55.49%. The control system simulation results indicate that the system uses 4.5kWh and 2.075kWh of energy to run the pump and the auxiliary heater respectively and produces 26.187kWh of energy to heat up the cold water from 25oC to 70oC for a single day. © 2021, International Journal of Renewable Energy Research.

AB  - In recent years, the Iraqi construction sector has faced many abandoned projects that have a negative impact on stakeholders, the economy, and the environment. Retrofitting existing buildings offer significant opportunities to reduce energy consumption and carbon emissions since buildings consume the largest amount of energy. The research methodology adopting building information Modeling (BIM) technology, is one of the modern techniques for retrofitting abandoned buildings to achieve low energy buildings and reduce the environmental effect. The concept of the study is applied to one of the projects in Iraq. The author finds that the use of BIM technology is very useful in carrying out various analyses and helping to find retrofitting strategies to improve the energy efficiency of the project. The results showed that the energy savings of 24% of the total improvement compared to the baseline design situation and the most efficient alternatives are heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems with energy savings of 71.36 kWh/m2 .year. © 2021, Materials and Energy Research Center.

TI  - A New Framework to Address BIM Interoperability in the AEC Domain from Technical and Process Dimensions
PY  - 2021
AU  - Ren, R.
AU  - Zhang, J.
AB  - Building information modelling (BIM) is an integrated informational process and plays a key role in enabling efficient planning and control of a project in the architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) domain. Industry foundation classes- (IFC-) based BIM allows building information to be interoperable among different BIM applications. Different stakeholders take different responsibilities in a project and therefore keep different types of information to meet project requirements. In this paper, the authors proposed and adopted a six-step methodology to support BIM interoperability between architectural design and structural analysis at both AEC project level and information level, in which (1) the intrinsic and extrinsic information transferred between architectural models and structural models was analyzed and demonstrated by a business process model and notation (BPMN) model that the authors developed; (2) the proposed technical routes with different combinations and their applications to different project delivery methods provided new instruments to stakeholders in industry for efficient and accurate decision making; (3) a new material-centered invariant signature with portability can improve information exchange between different data formats and models to support interoperable BIM applications; and (4) a newly developed formal material information representation and checking method was tested on a case study where its efficiency was demonstrated to outperform (i) proprietary representations and information checking method based on a manual operation, and (ii) the model view definition (MVD)-based information checking method. The proposed invariant signature-based material information representation and checking method brings a better efficiency for information transfer between architectural design and structural analysis, which can have significant positive effects on a project delivery due to the frequent and iterative update of a project design. This improves the information transfer and coordination between architects and structural engineers and therefore the efficiency of the whole project. The proposed method can be extended and applied to other application phases and functions such as cost estimation, scheduling, and energy analysis. © 2021 Ran Ren and Jiansong Zhang.

AB  - Energy consumption in buildings results in CO2 emissions and it is necessary to reduce energy consumption thus its related emissions. This research is included in the Wal-e-cities project, which is funded by the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) and aims to create tools that facilitate the transition toward smart territory. The annual heat consumption (HC) and heat demand (HD) of Wallonia building stock of more than 1,700,000 buildings are assessed. Subsequently, the developed energy models are coupled with a geographic information system (GIS) to calculate and map the HC and HD. The HC and HD are calculated for each building and are represented by different levels of territorial aggregation, namely neighbourhood, municipality, and urban region scales. The highest HC values were observed in large cities and main industrial areas, whereas the lowest values were observed in rural areas. For residential sector, HC is mainly related to the number of dwellings, which differs from that of tertiary and industrial sectors where HC also depends on the nature and function of buildings. Based on mean values at the neighbourhood scale, the HD is 16.44% lower than the HC for the residential sector, 15.78% lower than the HC for the tertiary sector, and 9.26% lower than the HC for the industrial sector. The proposed energy models are validated. The relative differences between annual HC calculated in this study and that provided in the regional energy reports are −5.82% for the residential sector, −14.29% for the tertiary sector, and −2.02% for the industrial sector. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Climate change has driven energy conservation into buildings, pressuring engineers into developing newer energy efficient buildings and effectively retrofitting the older ones. This research presents a practical method of creating an energy model of a modern office building using a Building Information Modelling (BIM)–Infra-Red Thermography (IRT)–Heat Flux sensors (HFS) framework that ensures a high level of accuracy with relative ease. The energy model is created with little input of the HVAC system, simulating real-life lack-of-information scenarios, and subsequently verified with consumption data extracted from the building’s own energy metre and the district’s chiller plant it’s connected to. The calibrated model is then used to investigate various passive heat-gain reduction measures through the building envelope such as the effect of the building’s orientation, shading, insulation levels, and window performance. Limitations of conserving energy through the building envelope were highlighted through the law of diminishing returns and the SHGC was pointed out to be the single most effective thermophysical window property in conserving energy. Numerically, the replacement of the windows saved 1.6% compared to the total 2.77% of energy saved. The study focuses on the climate of the United Arab Emirates and furthermore evaluates some BIM interoperability challenges. © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Data-centric innovation can inform the development of effective retrofit strategies through novel methods of collecting, analysing and sharing data. This bibliometric review uses a text-mining tool to identify research trends in dwelling retrofit research across North Western Europe. The review identifies a major focus on energy efficiency, with sub-themes on: 1) energy performance, 2) heat, power and control technologies, 3) indoor environment quality and 4) retrofit practice. In dwelling retrofit, there is now an established research tradition of using data-centric methods in monitoring and modelling energy performance to inform and learn from energy efficiency interventions. Building on the state-of-the-art, our analyses suggest opportunities for data-centric methods to consider the indoor environment quality and material impacts resulting from energy performance improvements. This information can then be openly communicated across the supply chain. Thus the paper discusses the retrofit themes and data-centric methods within North Western Europe, for an emerging trajectory of data-centric retrofit research and practice. © 2020

AB  - Occupant behavior and business processes in a building environment constitute an inseparable set of important factors that drives energy consumption. Existing methodologies for building energy management lag behind in addressing these core parameters by focusing explicitly on the building’s structural components. Additional layers of information regarding indoor and outdoor environmental conditions and occupant behavior patterns, mostly driven by everyday business processes (schedules, loads, and specific business activities related to occupancy patterns and building operations), are necessary for the effective and efficient modeling of building energy performance in order to establish a holistic energy efficiency management framework. The aim of this paper was to develop a context-driven framework in which multiple levels of information regarding occupant behavior patterns resulting from everyday business processes were incorporated for efficient energy management in buildings. A preliminary framework evaluation was performed in a multifaceted university building involving a number of spaces, employees, business processes, and data from sensors and metering devices. The results derived by linking operational aspects and environmental conditions (temperature, humidity, and luminance) to occupant behavior underlying business processes and organizational structures indicated the potential energy savings: A max of 7.08% for Heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC), 19.46% for lighting and a maximum of 6.34% saving related to office appliances. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - The highest challenge of energy efficiency of building stock is achieving improved performance in existing buildings and, especially, in heritage buildings which per se are characterized by massive limitations against the implementation of the most sophisticated solutions for energy saving. In Italy, historical buildings represent more than 30% of the building stock and the vast majority require energy retrofit, while ensuring the preservation of the heritage value and acceptable comfort conditions. In this context, historical buildings must be retrofitted and re-functioned by introducing innovative technologies aimed at reducing energy consumption and improving human comfort, health, and safety. To this aim, this study implements the Historic Building Information Modeling (HBIM) approach for the integrated modeling, monitoring, management, and maintenance of a novel geothermal system involving horizontal ground source heat exchangers (GHEXs) coupled to an adsorption heat pump for the energy refurbishment of historical buildings. In detail, a rural building part of a medieval complex in Perugia, Central Italy, is considered as a pilot case study. The analysis stresses the potential of the Facility Management (FM) applications of HBIM to provide a tool for the human-centric operational management control of the building energy performance and indoor comfort when combined with the building monitoring and supervision system. Therefore, this integrated HBIM approach may drive the path towards the user-centric re-functioning of heritage buildings. © 2020 by the authors

AB  - Domestic hot water heat use prediction modelling is an important instrument for increasing energy efficiency in many buildings. This article addressed hourly domestic hot water heat use prediction, using a Norwegian hotel as a case study. Since the information available for buildings may vary, two widespread situations with different input variables were studied. For the first situation, the prediction is based only on data obtained from historical measured domestic hot water heat use. For the second situation, additional variables that affect domestic hot water heat use were applied. These variables were determined using the Wrapper approach. The Wrapper approach showed that factors related to the guests presence have the most significant influence on the domestic hot water heat use in the hotel. Nevertheless, daily data about the number of guests booked at the hotel did not appear to be informative enough for precise hourly modelling. Therefore, to improve the accuracy of the prediction, it was proposed to use an artificial variable. This artificial variable explained the hourly intensity of the guests domestic hot water use. In order to select the best model for the domestic hot water heat use prediction, ten advanced time series and machine learning techniques were tested based on the criteria of models adequacy. For both considered situations, the Prophet model showed the best results with R2 equal to 0.76 for the first situation, and 0.83 the second situation. © 2020 The Authors

AB  - Urban planners, local authorities, and energy policymakers often develop strategic sustainable energy plans for the urban building stock in order to minimize overall energy consumption and emissions. Planning at such scales could be informed by building stock modeling using existing building data and Geographic Information System-based mapping. However, implementing these processes involves several issues, namely, data availability, data inconsistency, data scalability, data integration, geocoding, and data privacy. This research addresses the aforementioned information challenges by proposing a generalized integrated methodology that implements bottom-up, data-driven, and spatial modeling approaches for multi-scale Geographic Information System mapping of building energy modeling. This study uses the Irish building stock to map building energy performance at multiple scales. The generalized data-driven methodology uses approximately 650,000 Irish Energy Performance Certificates buildings data to predict more than 2 million buildings’ energy performance. In this case, the approach delivers a prediction accuracy of 88% using deep learning algorithms. These prediction results are then used for spatial modeling at multiple scales from the individual building level to a national level. Furthermore, these maps are coupled with available spatial resources (social, economic, or environmental data) for energy planning, analysis, and support decision-making. The modeling results identify clusters of buildings that have a significant potential for energy savings within any specific region. Geographic Information System-based modeling aids stakeholders in identifying priority areas for implementing energy efficiency measures. Furthermore, the stakeholders could target local communities for retrofit campaigns, which would enhance the implementation of sustainable energy policy decisions. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Buildings are one of the major responsible of energy consumption and carbon emissions worldwide. Due to the continuous growth of cities, researchers moved their focus from single buildings to urban scale analyses. The present work aims at demonstrating the reliability of a lumped-capacitance model in the evaluation of heating and cooling demand at urban level. The model presented extends a previous one with different modules for solar radiation pre-processing, HVAC systems and photovoltaic production estimation. A case-study district of 13 buildings in Padua (Italy) has been analysed, considering detailed single buildings simulations with EnergyPlus as benchmark. Results show that the model leads to good accuracy in the evaluation of the district energy demand for both space heating and cooling. The major sources of error are geometrical simplifications, shadowing and thermal zoning effects, thus showing the importance of high-quality input data in urban modelling. However, results highlight how simple corrections may enhance the accuracy when detailed geometrical information is not available. Finally, the model has been used to assess the cost and energy saving potential of several building retrofit measures and PV installations on the considered district, providing an important indication in the investment priority for decision makers. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In the Energy Efficiency field, the incorporation of intelligent systems in cities and buildings is motivated by the energy savings and pollution reduction that can be attained. To achieve this goal, energy modelling and a better understanding of how energy is consumed are fundamental factors. As a result, this study proposes a methodology for knowledge acquisition in energy-related data through Time-Series Clustering (TSC) techniques. In our experimentation, we utilize data from the buildings at the University of Granada (Spain) and compare several clustering methods to get the optimum model, in particular, we tested k-Means, k-Medoids, Hierarchical clustering and Gaussian Mixtures; as well as several algorithms to obtain the best grouping, such as PAM, CLARA, and two variants of Lloyd's method, Small and Large. Thus, our methodology can provide non-trivial knowledge from raw energy data. In contrast to previous studies in this field, not only do we propose a clustering methodology to group time series straightforwardly, but we also present an automatic strategy to search and analyse energy periodicity in these series recursively so that we can deepen granularity and extract information at different levels of detail. The results show that k-Medoids with PAM is the best approach in virtually all cases, and the Squared Euclidean distance outperforms the rest of the metrics. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Quantifying the strength, sign, and origin of species interactions, along with their dependence on environmental context, is at the heart of prediction and understanding in ecological communities. Pairwise interaction models like Lotka-Volterra provide an important and flexible foundation, but notably absent is an explicit mechanism mediating interactions. Consumer-resource models incorporate mechanism, but describing competitive and mutualistic interactions is more ambiguous. Here, we bridge this gap by modeling a coarse-grained version of a species’ true cellular metabolism to describe resource consumption via uptake and conversion into biomass, energy, and byproducts. This approach does not require detailed chemical reaction information, but it provides a more explicit description of underlying mechanisms than pairwise interaction or consumer-resource models. Using a model system, we find that when metabolic reactions require two distinct resources we recover Liebig’s Law and multiplicative co-limitation in particular limits of the intracellular reaction rates. In between these limits, we derive a more general phenomenological form for consumer growth rate, and we find corresponding rates of secondary metabolite production, allowing us to model competitive and non-competitive interactions (e.g., facilitation). Using the more general form, we show how secondary metabolite production can support coexistence even when two species compete for a shared resource, and we show how differences in metabolic rates change species’ abundances in equilibrium. Building on these findings, we make the case for incorporating coarse-grained metabolism to update the phenomenology we use to model species interactions. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.

TI  - BIM-based techno-economic assessment of energy retrofitting residential buildings in hot humid climate
PY  - 2020
AU  - Ahmed, W.
AU  - Asif, M.
AB  - Buildings in hot humid climates are energy intensive to operate. Energy consumption in Saudi Arabia is almost three times higher than the global average, and one of the major contributors to that is the residential sector. Increasing environmental and economic concerns, in the form of Saudi Vision 2030, mean that the existing unsustainable residential building stock has to be energy retrofitted. This study examines the techno-economic feasibility of retrofitting existing homes in Eastern Province, Saudi Arabia. A Building Information Modelling (BIM)-based retrofit framework has been adopted and investigated on two case studies. Eight Energy Efficiency Measures (EEMs) have been implemented including increasing cooling set point temperature, using energy efficient appliances, replacing conventional lights with more efficient lights, applying window shading, improving glazing type, improving air tightness, using more efficient air conditioning system, and adding envelope insulation. A three-level energy retrofit plan is proposed. Results indicate that annual energy consumption in a villa is reduced by 13.79%, 19.27% and 56.9%, and in the apartment building by 22.84%, 28.85% and 58.5% through a level 1, 2 and 3 retrofit respectively. Compound Payback Period (CPP) was computed to assess the economic viability. For the villa, investing in a level 1, 2 and 3 retrofit will pay back in 0.92, 8.37 and 25.15 years respectively, while for the apartment building, the payback period is 0.60, 11.28 and 24.60 years respectively. Thus, energy retrofitting of existing homes has the potential to significantly reduce energy consumption, however, it is economically not viable in the existing scenario. Electricity tariffs need to be further increased and coupled with incentive programs to render deep energy retrofits feasible. Furthermore, the investigated BIM-based approach can be adopted to investigate energy retrofitting in other climate zones of Saudi Arabia and other countries in the region, and eventually be adopted to efficiently effectuate the colossal task of retrofitting the whole existing residential building stocks of these countries. © 2020

TI  - An optimal home energy management system for modulating heat pumps and photovoltaic systems
PY  - 2020
AU  - Langer, L.

AB  - Efficient residential sector coupling plays a key role in supporting the energy transition. In this study, we analyze the structural properties associated with the optimal control of a home energy management system and the effects of common technological configurations and objectives. We conduct this study by modeling a representative building with a modulating air-sourced heat pump, a photovoltaic (PV) system, a battery, and thermal storage systems for floor heating and hot-water supply. In addition, we allow grid feed-in by assuming fixed feed-in tariffs and consider user comfort. In our numerical analysis, we find that the battery, naturally, is the essential building block for improving self-sufficiency. However, in order to use the PV surplus efficiently grid feed-in is necessary. The commonly considered objective of maximizing self-consumption is not economically viable under the given tariff structure; however, close-to-optimal performance and significant reduction in solution times can be achieved by maximizing self-sufficiency. Based on optimal control and considering seasonal effects, the dominant order of PV distribution and the target states of charge of the storage systems can be derived. Using a rolling horizon approach, the solution time can be reduced to less than 1min (achieving a time resolution of 1h per year). By evaluating the value of information, we find that the common horizon of 24h for prediction and control results in unintended but avoidable end-of-horizon effects. Our input data and mixed-integer linear model developed using the Julia JuMP programming language are available in an open-source manner. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The study investigated the level of thermal comfort in historical buildings located at a relatively high altitude in the Arabian Desert of Saudi Arabia. The study focused on the impact of the use of thermal mass and orientation on the level of thermal performance at Shubra and Boqri Palaces. Qualitative and quantitative analyses were used in this study, including a questionnaire interview with architecture experts living at the relatively high altitude of Taif city, to obtain data and information from local experts. The computer software TAS EDSL was used along with onsite equipment, such as thermal imaging cameras and data loggers, to observe the physical conditions of the building in terms of its thermal performance. The study revealed that the experts’ age and years of experience were important aspects while collecting data from them during the survey. The use of thermal mass had a slight impact on the indoor air temperature as well as the energy consumption, but it helped in providing thermal comfort. Use of ventilation can improve thermal comfort level. Evaporative cooling technique has a considerable impact on reducing indoor air temperature with 4 °C drop, improving the thermal comfort sensation level. The novelty of this work is that, it links the outcomes of qualitative results of experts with field monitoring as well as computer modelling. This can contribute as method to accurately collect data in similar case studies. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - The high concentration of pollutant sources, complex topography, and regional meteorology are all factors that may contribute to air episodes in dense urban areas. Energy use in buildings is a significant source of pollution in the Greater Athens Area (GAA), Greece, where over 90% of the existing building stock has been classified below energy class B. The present study focuses on the potential effects that a realistic level of building energy efficiency upgrades will have on the air quality over the GAA. Results are expected to be relevant to similar urban areas. Furthermore, the study of primary pollutants’ dispersion is applied at a 1.2 × 1.2 km spatial resolution, providing significant local (neighborhood) level information. Numerical simulations were performed using EPA’s CALPUFF modeling system with wind field input from an independent numerical weather prediction using NCAR’s Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model. In order to calculate emission rates from major roads, highways, shipping ports, residential heating installations, and major industrial facilities, data were taken from National and European statistics, demographics, and local topography. After validation, the modeling system was used to examine three building energy efficiency upgrade scenarios, implemented on 20% of the buildings. Ground level concentrations of SO2, NOx, CO, and PM10 were calculated and reductions of up to 9% were found for GAA maximum values but up to 18% for local values that were also close to or above the European safety thresholds. © 2020 by the authors.

PY  - 2020
AU  - Gavali, H.R.
AU  - Ralegaonkar, R.V.
AB  - Gradually, the temperature of the earth is increasing due to global warming, which has increased the operational energy demand in buildings. This energy usage can substantially be reduced using energy-efficient measures such as developing a thermally resistant building envelope. The building envelope mainly consists of walls, roof and floor, where walls play an important role in heat transfer that is a major contributor to operational energy demand. In this study, a walling material (alkali-activated bricks) was developed, where locally available industrial wastes (co-fired blended ash and stone dust (CBA-SD)) were activated by a sodium-based alkali activator and cured at an ambient temperature of around 37°C. The alkali-activated bricks were evaluated for mechanical-, physical-, thermal- and durability-related properties that are in accordance with Indian standards. The results showed that the developed alkali-activated bricks are lighter in weight and have lower thermal conductivity (0.35-0.4 W/(m K)) as compared to conventional fly-ash (FA) bricks (1.05 W/(m K)). A case of a residential building with varying building envelope and number of floors was simulated for analysing building performance using a computational approach. As compared to FA bricks, the CBA-SD brick model resulted in peak cooling load reduction by 49-51, 46-48 and 44-46% for single-, two- and three-storeyed buildings, respectively. © 2020 ICE Publishing.

AB  - Building envelopes and regional conditions can significantly contribute to the cost and energy performance of the buildings. Structured methods that take into account the impacts of both the envelope materials and the regional conditions to find the most feasible envelope materials within a region, however, are still missing. This study responds to this need by proposing a novel method using the capabilities of Building Information Modeling (BIM). The proposed method is used for identifying cost- and energy-efficient building envelope materials within a region over the life cycle. First, commonly used envelope materials in a region are identified. Then, BIM is employed for simulating the energy performance and evaluating the life cycle cost of the materials. The method was implemented in Tehran, Iran. It was successfully utilized for improving the cost and energy performance of a nine-story residential building case. The achieved results indicated a potential energy performance enhancement of 31%, and the life cycle cost improvement of 28% by replacing conventionally used envelope materials with the available high-performance building materials. The proposed method can benefit various stakeholders in the building construction industry, including municipalities, owners, contractors, and consumers, by enhancing the cost and energy performance of the buildings. © 2020 Materials and Energy Research Center.

AB  - As a remedy to excessive amounts of energy consumption, adverse impacts on the environment, and ineffective use of resources in the construction industry, the number of green buildings (GBs) is increasing all over the world. Design and construction of GBs involve processes different from those used for conventional buildings. Having particular activities, functions, and physical aspects, GBs impose their own difficulties during these phases. Building information modeling (BIM) systems use several software packages for virtual simulation of project characteristics, which promotes early detection of potential problems even before production of the intended design details. In this study, evaluation of Yildiz Technical University (YTU), Faculty of Civil Engineering (YTUFCE) building using BIM tools based on leadership in energy and environmental design (LEED) v4 BD+C: Schools certification system is presented, which was prepared as part of a capstone project by senior civil engineering students. First, the building was assessed with respect to achievable credits with its current state through a three-dimensional (3D) model. Students were encouraged to consider which sustainable practices would be applicable if the building was originally designed and built as a GB. Then, the building was reassessed with the intention for additional applicable credits and corresponding points. The construction phase was also reviewed for extra credit points that could be earned from construction activities to contribute to LEED certification. The main objective is to introduce students to two major trends in the construction industry, namely GB and BIM applications, and create awareness of sustainable construction, GB certification systems, and emerging technologies. © 2020 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB  - Interdisciplinary cross-cultural and cross-organizational research offers great opportunities for innovative breakthroughs in the field of smart cities, yet it also presents organizational and knowledge development hurdles. Smart cities must be large towns able to sustain the needs of their citizens while promoting environmental sustainability. Smart cities foment the widespread use of novel information and communication technologies (ICTs); however, experimenting with these technologies in such a large geographical area is unfeasible. Consequently, smart campuses (SCs), which are universities where technological devices and applications create new experiences or services and facilitate operational efficiency, allow experimentation on a smaller scale, the concept of SCs as a testbed for a smart city is gaining momentum in the research community. Nevertheless, while universities acknowledge the academic role of a smart and sustainable approach to higher education, campus life and other student activities remain a mystery, which have never been universally solved. This paper proposes a SC concept to investigate the integration of building information modeling tools with Internet of Things-(IoT)-based wireless sensor networks in the fields of environmental monitoring and emotion detection to provide insights into the level of comfort. Additionally, it explores the ability of universities to contribute to local sustainability projects by sharing knowledge and experience across a multi-disciplinary team. Preliminary results highlight the significance of monitoring workspaces because productivity has been proven to be directly influenced by environment parameters. The comfort-monitoring infrastructure could also be reused to monitor physical parameters from educational premises to increase energy efficiency. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - Cities are ought to play a key role in the energy transition to a low carbon society as they concentrate more than half of the world's population and are responsible for about 67% primary energy consumption and around 70% of the energy-related CO2 emissions. To achieve the agreed climate targets, efficient urban planning is a must. Tools and methods have risen to model different aspects of the energy performance of urban areas. Nevertheless, addressing the complexity of a city energy system is a great challenge and new integrated tools and methods are still needed. This paper presents a methodology for integrated city energy modelling and assessment, from the characterization of the city's current energy performance to the development and assessment of future scenarios. Energy characterization is based on the combination of bottom-up approaches with top-down data to establish the city's energy baseline. This baseline integrates bottom-up results from a GIS based model which is used to characterize the city's building stock energy performance, while available information on the vehicle stock is used to model the mobility sector. Scenarios are developed from this baseline and assessed through a multi-criteria impact assessment model. A simplified case study is carried out for the city of Valencia (Spain) to demonstrate the suggested methodology, and results are shown for three different scenarios: one focused on the building sector, one on transport, and one combining measures in both sectors. The transport-focused scenario demonstrates to be the most favourable in terms of energy savings and emissions reductions. The application of the proposed method is intended to support the development of strategies and plans for energy transition at city level. The main challenges for its application in cities are data availability at urban level, the uncertainty related to modelling the transport sector, and the unavailability of adapted I/O tables at city scale to assess socioeconomic impacts. © 2020

AB  - Data-driven methods have been widely applied in the prediction of energy consumption in buildings. However, existing well-established data-driven models can hardly be used for energy-efficient design. This study aims to explore the underlying causes and propose an innovative method to exclusively develop models for energy-efficient design. First, a conventional modeling process was implemented, which includes data precession, statistical analysis, feature selection, and Random Forest classification. Second, an innovative two-step method was proposed to develop data-driven models for energy-efficient design. The first step involved identifying important designable features that can be designed through classification. The second step involved developing classification models for developing energy-efficient design. The experiments were performed on the Commercial Building Energy Consumption Survey (CBECS) dataset that contains 6720 non-residential buildings. The models were built with conventional methods to realize high classification accuracy. However, they cannot be used for energy-efficient design because they lack design variables such as the thickness of wall insulation. The main contributions of this study include the identification of important designable features and development of data-driven models exclusively for energy-efficient design. The proposed method can benefit designers in developing useful data-driven models for building energy-efficient design. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This paper reports and discusses the results of a field study focusing on the examination of thermal comfort conditions in two public buildings in Croatia. The wearable sensors were used for monitoring the occupants’ metabolic responses, along with the standard equipment for measuring thermal comfort. The occupants’ subjective comfort sensation was also investigated through a survey questionnaire and was used in conjunction with the measured data. A total number of eight occupants participated in the study, located in two office buildings in different climates. The modeling of the metabolic responses was obtained by means of artificial neural networks and the simulated values were compared with the measured ones. The validation of the models showed overlapping of 90%. However, they should be tested on a larger number of occupants. The study results revealed that the MET response usually varied between values 1.0 and 2.0, no matter the season, which is rather high for office activities according to standards, and indicates the inapplicability of static MET value usage in the calculation of PMV indexes. The implementation of wearable sensors provided accurate information on the dynamic changes of the building occupant's metabolic rate during working hours, enabling the reliable model algorithm creation to increase occupant satisfaction and potential energy savings. Finally, the differences between the two examined buildings’ thermal conditions were analyzed and useful findings regarding age, gender and physical fitness of occupants and their satisfactory level of comfort conditions were presented. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Urban building energy modeling (UBEM) is attracting increasing attention in the energy modeling filed. Unlike modeling a single building using detailed building systems information, UBEM generally uses limited high-level building stock data to infer default assumptions about building characteristics and operations. This practice inherently brings uncertainty to UBEM. This study introduced a novel method of automatic and rapid calibration of UBEM based on the annual electricity and natural gas energy use data by learning the correlations between crucial model input parameters and the building energy use from the reference building models. A case study was presented to calibrate 72 large office buildings built before 1978 in San Francisco. Seventeen model parameters were selected and Monte Carlo sampling was used to create 1000 samples that reasonably represent the parameter space. Then 1000 simulations were performed for the reference building model to create an energy performance database. The results showed that by learning from the energy performance database, it took less than four simulation runs on average to calibrate a building model. After the calibration, the distributions of each parameter were obtained to replace their single predefined default values. For example, the default lighting power density of 21.39 W/m2 was calibrated to be 7.50 W/m2 on average. The case study successfully demonstrated the effectiveness of the novel calibration method for UBEM in the mild climate. The method will be further tested in future for other climate zones and other building types. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The construction sector has a major contribution to resource depletion, high energy consumption and a high negative impact on the environment; hence, the need to improve sustainability in the construction sector has appeared. In this study, Building Information Modeling (BIM) technology is adopted as one of the modern techniques that contribute significantly in improve sustainability. This research aims to investigate around the impact of design parameter alternatives (orientation, window-to-wall ratio, window glass type) on electric energy performance and electric energy cost, study the role of BIM tools in water usage analysis and increase water efficiency and investigate the capabilities provided by BIM tools to improve natural ventilation. Educational project (Deanship building) of Agriculture College at Diyala University is considered as a case study. The result that illustrates the most effective alternatives is window-to-wall ratio with energy-saving around (21,439 kWh/year) and cost-saving around (1929$/year) as well as illustrates water usage indoor around (1,530,385 L/year) and outdoor around (1,063,385 L/year) and indoor water saving around (17.7%) based on fixture efficiency. Also, the results show BIM tools very useful in improving natural ventilation. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Mixed-use buildings contribute to the sustainable development of cities by providing economic, environmental, and social benefits. Energy management of these buildings still remains a challenge due to their unpredictable energy consumption characteristics and the lack of design guidelines for energy efficiency and sustainability solutions. Energy consumption forecasting models have been crucial to the improvement of energy efficiency and sustainability of buildings but its application to mixed-use buildings are limited. Hence, this study aims to develop a prediction model to characterize and forecast the energy consumption of mixed-use buildings. Machine learning techniques are employed in the proposed prediction model which used k-means algorithm for clustering and support vector machines for forecasting. The prediction model was developed and demonstrated on simulated energy consumption of 30 mixed-use buildings from the open energy information database. The clustering results have found major differences in the consumption behavior of building clusters, especially on peaking characteristics. The differences were highlighted in terms of the domain knowledge on residential and commercial energy consumption behavior. The forecasting model results showed that the proposed integration of the clustering model was able to capture unique variations in the energy consumption of mixed-use buildings. This led to a 46% decrease in the mean bias error and a 10% decrease in the coefficient of variation root mean square error wherein both indicators are commonly used in building energy modeling standards. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

AB  - Real-time collection of household electricity consumption data has been facilitated by an advanced metering infrastructure. In recent studies, collected data have been processed to provide information on household appliance usage. The noise caused by electrical appliances from neighboring households constitutes a major issue, which is related to discomfort and even mental diseases. The assessment of noise discomfort using electricity consumption data has not been dealt with in the literature up to this day. In this study, a method that utilizes electricity consumption data for the assessment of noise discomfort levels caused by electrical appliances between neighboring households is proposed. This method is based on the differences in the usage time of electrical appliances in a collective residential building. The proposed method includes the following four steps: data collection and preprocessing, residential units clustering, noise discomfort modeling, and evaluation of noise discomfort. This method is demonstrated through a case study of a campus apartment building. Variations in the noise discomfort assessment model and measures for alleviating noise discomfort are also discussed. The proposed method can guide the application of electricity consumption data to the assessment and alleviation of noise discomfort from home appliances at an apartment building. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - The energy-efficient building design requires building performance simulation (BPS) to compare multiple design options for their energy performance. However, at the early stage, BPS is often ignored, due to uncertainty, lack of details, and computational time. This article studies probabilistic and deterministic approaches to treat uncertainty; detailed and simplified zoning for creating zones; and dynamic simulation and machine learning for making energy predictions. A state-of-the-art approach, such as dynamic simulation, provide a reliable estimate of energy demand, but computationally expensive. Reducing computational time requires the use of an alternative approach, such as a machine learning (ML) model. However, an alternative approach will cause a prediction gap, and its effect on comparing options needs to be investigated. A plugin for Building information modelling (BIM) modelling tool has been developed to perform BPS using various approaches. These approaches have been tested for an office building with five design options. A method using the probabilistic approach to treat uncertainty, detailed zoning to create zones, and EnergyPlus to predict energy is treated as the reference method. The deterministic or ML approach has a small prediction gap, and the comparison results are similar to the reference method. The simplified model approach has a large prediction gap and only makes only 40% comparison results are similar to the reference method. These findings are useful to develop a BIM integrated tool to compare options at the early design stage and ascertain which approach should be adopted in a time-constraint situation. © 2020

AB  - In regions where natural gas is used for both power generation and heating buildings, extreme cold weather events can place the electrical system under enormous stress and challenge the ability to meet residential heating and electric demands. Residential demand response has long been used in the power sector to curtail summer electric load, but these types of programs in general have not seen adoption in the natural gas sector during winter months. Natural gas demand response (NG-DR) has garnered interest given recent extreme cold weather events in the United States; however, the magnitude of savings and potential impacts—to occupants and energy markets—are not well understood. We present a case-study analysis of the technical potential for residential natural gas demand response in the northeast United States that utilizes diverse whole-building energy simulations and high-performance computing. Our results show that NG-DR applied to residential heating systems during extreme cold-weather conditions could reduce natural gas demand by 1–29% based on conservative and aggressive strategies, respectively. This indicates a potential to improve the resilience of gas and electric systems during stressful events, which we examine by estimating the impact on energy costs and electricity generation from natural gas. We also explore relationships between hourly indoor temperatures, demand response, and building envelope efficiency. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - The paper presents the public building typology, energy demand estimations and retrofit scenarios, as well as associated costs and benefits for energy-saving measures in the public building stock of Albania. First, representative building types were identified to estimate their energy performance, and define retrofit packages. Second, this information was used to analyse the costs and benefits of the different thermal efficiency retrofits. Apart from specific benefits due to cost savings in the use phase, co-benefits were estimated to understand their dimension and influence on decision-making. Finally, energy efficiency supply curves were developed to show the priority sequence of retrofits and building types. It was found that due to the growing wealth in Albania, user behaviour will change a lot in the future. Energy usage in the public building sector will increase and mitigate savings resulting from energy-saving measures making saved energy costs invisible. However, if other benefits beyond energy savings are considered, the cost efficiency of the measures remain obvious. The recommended approach can be used to assist decision-making and allocate funds. © 2020, The Author(s).

AB  - Prolonged overheating can have serious cumulative effects on human health, resulting in heat exhaustion, heatstroke and even death. The frequency and severity of heatwaves will increase considerably in the future as a result of accelerating climatic changes compounded by increasing urbanisation. A recent overheating risk-assessment methodology, Technical Memorandum (TM)59: 2017 was developed by the Chartered Institution of Building Services Engineers (CIBSE) to address this problem, by providing a consistent framework for the evaluation of overheating risks in new homes. TM59 has for the first time highlighted the importance of including corridor heat transfer effects in the dynamic modelling of multi-residential dwellings. This paper investigates the strengths and limitations of current approaches to the modelling of corridors, based on a case study of three energy-efficient flats located in London. The results of modelling in accordance with TM59 guidance are compared with alternative approaches, using more realistic occupancy and weather information, and compared to empirically measured data. The findings of this study indicate that current practices in Building Performance Simulation (BPS) are likely to under-estimate the actual air temperatures in corridors. This study highlights the need for further research into the way in which corridors, flats and their interconnecting ventilation and heat transfer networks are commonly discretised in BPS models. © 2020 The Authors

AB  - There is a significant share of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions attributed to the built environment, either for production or the operation of buildings. Various initiatives are being implemented to reduce the release of GHGs into the atmosphere relying on the evaluation, tracking, recording and verification of GHG emissions and removals. The annual accounting of GHG flows associated with buildings should be conducted in a lifecycle context to ensure that policies are effective at mitigating climate change. Buildings operate for decades and both the climate and electricity grid mix are expected to change significantly during such a time frame. This study aims to support the design of resource- as well as energy-efficient buildings using a sound life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology in the preliminary design stage. A straightforward method that can be applied for a detailed understanding of the effects of climate change and prospective electricity grid mix on building energy use is presented. The novelty of this study was to integrate long-term energy projections in a high temporal resolution LCA for buildings and taking into account different future climates and prospective electricity mixes across Canada. The research integrated the dynamic LCA capabilities directly into a Building Information Model (BIM). Such dynamic considerations as climate and energy mix improves the environmental importance and scientific robustness of LCA metrics. The proposed methodology will assist users to apply a clear framework that helps to define an optimized design alternative through a dynamic energy analysis and future weather forecasting simulation. An example of an actual office building is provided to demonstrate the capabilities and usefulness of the developed integrated framework. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this study; based on energy-efficient design parameters, the effects of building design parameters on the energy consumption of the building were examined. Accordingly, a reference building has been created as an example of application in the hot-humid climate zone. In the process of modelling the building, BIM (Building Information Modelling) software Autodesk Revit was used. The model has been transferred to Green Building Studio (GBS) for energy performance analysis and evaluation of design alternatives. The parameters evaluated in terms of energy consumption of the building were selected from among the design alternatives produced by GBS, based on energy-efficient design parameters. As a result of the energy performance analysis of the reference building via GBS, the building's annual electricity consumption is 35,137 kWh and the annual fuel consumption is 93,729 MJ. Based on the evaluation of selected design parameters as a result of reference building energy performance analysis; HVAC systems have been found to have the most impact on energy consumption (rates of changes; 36.83% in annual electricity consumption, 90.27% in annual fuel consumption). HVAC systems, selected to be highly efficient and suitable for climate type, have the potential to save significant energy in the amount of energy consumption throughout the life cycle. In addition to this, as of the early design phase, the energy efficient design of the building is of great importance in terms of a holistic evaluation and maximum energy efficiency. © 2020 MIM Research Group.

AB  - Building information modeling can help in predicting the energy efficiency in future based on dynamic patterns obtained by visualization of data. The aim of this study was to investigate the effective parameters of energy consumption using BIM technology which can evaluate the buildings energy performance. First, three forms of general states in the building were modeled to evaluate the proposed designs in Autodesk Revit Software. Then, the main building form for energy modeling and analysis was selected. Autodesk Revit 2020 software was also used to obtain the results of climate data analysis and building energy consumption index. Finally, the most optimal mode was selected by examining different energy consumption modes. The results showed that the use of building information modeling technology in adjusting the parameters affecting energy consumption can save energy cost up to 58.23% in block D. Energy cost savings for block C and the western lobby were obtained as 51.03% and 43.05%, respectively. Based on energy use intensity, energy cost savings for blocks C, D, and the western lobby were estimated as 16.67%, 16.30%, and 11%, respectively. The results of parametric studies on alternative schemes of energy use intensity optimization showed that 16.30% savings could be achieved by the base building model in a 30-year time horizon. Therefore, it was concluded that optimization of energy consumption would reduce the environmental pollutants emission and contribute to preservation and sustainability of the environment. © 2020 GJESM.

AB  - An increase in the usage of information and communication technologies (ICT) and the Internet of Things (IoT) in Facility Management (FM) induces a huge data stack. Even though these data bring opportunities such as cost savings, time savings, increase in user comfort, space optimization, energy savings, inventory management, etc., these data sources cannot be managed and manipulated effectively to increase efficiency at the FM stage. In addition to data management issues, FM practices, or developed solutions, need to be supported with the implementation of lean management philosophy to reveal organizational and managerial wastes. In the literature, some researchers performed studies about awareness about building information modeling (BIM)-FM, and FM-related data management problems in terms of lean philosophy. However, the comprehensive solution for effective FM has not been investigated with the application of lean management philosophy yet. Therefore, this study aims to develop an FM framework for healthcare facilities by considering lean management philosophy since more stable workflow, continuous improvement, and creating more value to customers will help to deliver a more acceptable solution for the FM industry. Within this context, the integration of BIM, Building Energy Performance Simulations, and Big Data Analytics are proposed as a solution. In the study, the Design Science Research (DSR) methodology was followed to develop the FM framework. Depending on the DSR methodology, two scenarios were used to investigate the issue in a real healthcare facility and develop the FM framework. The developed framework was evaluated by four experts, and the revisions of the proposed framework were realized. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - All over the world, the construction sector is the largest consumer of energy, which has a negative impact on the environment. In this article, the research methodology is adopting building information modeling (BIM) technology in 3D simulation and energy analysis. This study aims using BIM technology to improve indoor daylight performance of the building, determine the proper and comfortable artificial lighting of the building and their costs compared with the traditional methods used to calculate lighting, calculate the amount of renewable energy and cost saving that can be obtained from the photovoltaic panels, assess energy performance analysis at design stage and then create design alternatives to increase energy efficiency. The idea of this research was applied in one of the Iraqi projects; the authors found that applying BIM technology helps a lot in increasing energy performance efficiency through many strategies and it also gives the ability to solve all problems related to the performance of energy in the design stage. The results concluded that applying BIM technology improves indoor daylight performance of the building where the artificial lighting reduce around (29 lamps) as well as the cost of lamps reduce around (6500ID), use photovoltaic(PV) panels reduce annual energy consumption around 44% as well as achieves cost-saving about (22,601 $/year), total electricity consumption equal to (421,645 kw h/year) and total fuel consumption equal to (565,633 MJ/year). Also, the results explain the HVAC system is the most effective alternative where annual energy saving is around (50%). © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - A significant portion of all energy generated is used to heat and cool buildings. Some of that energy can be saved by using a temperature controller with access to an accurate forecast of a building's internal temperature. These forecasts depend on information gathered from sensors, including temperature, humidity, sunlight, and the electrical load of cooking and laundry appliances. Using publicly available data from two homes with a wide variety of sensors, we forecast internal temperature by modelling it as a linear function of recent sensor values. These models are built using techniques that improve upon standard least squares regression: forward stepwise, ridge and lasso regressions, using cross-validation. With lasso regression, we accurately forecast internal temperature every quarter hour over the next 48 h within 1.8°C in both houses. We also forecast temperature changes over each quarter-hour for the next two days, within 0.05°C, which significantly improves on previous forecasts of temperature changes using the same data. We propose a business model for forecasting as a service, where guarantees of consistent accuracy are important for attracting clients and saving energy. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Human preference-based control in buildings may achieve maximum occupant satisfaction as well as energy savings. Adaptive and online learning methods are needed for learning human preferences, using the minimum amount of data possible with quantified uncertainty. This paper presents an online visual preference elicitation learning framework, developed for efficiently learning occupants' visual preference profiles and hidden satisfaction utility functions in daylit offices. A combination of Thompson sampling and pure exploration (uncertainty learning) methods was used in the sequential elicitation framework, to determine the set of successive visual preference queries (for visual conditions) with most information gain. In this way, a balance between exploration and exploitation is realized and the area around the satisfaction utility maximum is learned with minimum number of steps. Experiments with human subjects were conducted in private sidelit offices to demonstrate the feasibility and performance of the learning framework. A single-variable model (vertical illuminance) was used to demonstrate the method and visualize results. The entropy of the distribution of the most preferred visual condition is computed for each learned preference profile to quantify the certainty and evaluate the learning efficiency. Our method learns most individual visual preferences to an acceptable certainty level within one day, and indicates the need for personalization. Finally, we discuss the integration of visual preferences into control applications. A switching algorithm is proposed, shifting iteratively between the learning and control modes depending on the certainty of the learned preference model. This work contributes to developing comprehensive online learning methods towards preference-based tuned indoor environments. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Mathematical modeling for short term indoor room temperature forecasting using Box-Jenkins models: An Indian evidence
PY  - 2020
AU  - Pandey, K.

AB  - Purpose: The rapid urbanization of Indian cities and the population surge in cities has steered a massive demand for energy, thereby increasing the carbon emissions in the environment. Information and technology advancements, aided by predictive tools, can optimize this energy demand and help reduce harmful carbon emissions. Out of the multiple factors governing the energy consumption and comfort of buildings, indoor room temperature is a critical one, as it envisages the need for regulating the temperature. This paper aims to propose a mathematical model for short-term forecasting of indoor room temperature in the Indian context to optimize energy consumption and reduce carbon emissions in the environment. Design/methodology/approach: A study is conducted to forecast the indoor room temperature of an Indian corporate building structure, based upon various external environmental factors: temperature and rainfall and internal factors like cooling control, occupancy behavior and building characteristics. Expert insight and principal component analysis are applied for appropriate variables selection. The machine learning approach using Box–Jenkins time series models is used for the forecasting of indoor room temperature. Findings: ARIMAX model, with lagged forecasted and explanatory variables, is found to be the best-fit model. A predictive short-term hourly temperature forecasting model is developed based upon ARIMAX model, which yields fairly accurate results for data set pertaining to the building conditions and climatic parameters in the Indian context. Results also investigate the relationships between the forecasted and individual explanatory variables, which are validated using theoretical proofs. Research limitations/implications: The models considered in this research are Box–Jenkins models, which are linear time series models. There are non-linear models, such as artificial neural network models and deep learning models, which can be a part of this study. The study of hybrid models including combined forecasting techniques comprising linear and non-linear methods is another important area for future scope of study. As this study is based on a single corporate entity, the models developed need to be tested further for robustness and reliability. Practical implications: Forecasting of indoor room temperature provides essential practical information about meeting the in-future energy demand, that is, how much energy resources would be needed to maintain the equilibrium between energy consumption and building comfort. In addition, this forecast provides information about the prospective peak usage of air-conditioning controls within the building indoor control management system through a feedback control loop. The resultant model developed can be adopted for smart buildings within Indian context. Social implications: This study has been conducted in India, which has seen a rapid surge in population growth and urbanization. Being a developing country, India needs to channelize its energy needs judiciously by minimizing the energy wastage and reducing carbon emissions. This study proposes certain pre-emptive measures that help in minimizing the consumption of available energy resources as well as reducing carbon emissions that have significant impact on the society and environment at large. Originality/value: A large number of factors affecting the indoor room temperature present a research challenge for model building. The paper statistically identifies the parameters influencing the indoor room temperature forecasting and their relationship with the forecasted model. Considering Indian climatic, geographical and building structure conditions, the paper presents a systematic mathematical model to forecast hourly indoor room temperature for next 120 h with fair degree of accuracy. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Wireless Sensor Networks are very convenient to monitor structures or even materials, as in McBIM project (Materials communicating with the Building Information Modeling). This project aims to develop the concept of “communicating concretes,” which are concrete elements embedding wireless sensor networks, for applications dedicated to Structure Health Monitoring in the construction industry. Due to applicative constraints, the topology of the wireless sensor network follows a chain-based structure. Node batteries cannot be replaced or easily recharged, it is crucial to evaluate the energy consumed by each node during the monitoring process. This area has been extensively studied leading to different energy models to evaluate energy consumption for chain-based structures. However, no simple, practical, and analytical network energy models have yet been proposed. Energy evaluation models of periodic data collection for chain-based structures are proposed. These models are compared and evaluated with an Arduino XBee–based platform. Experimental results show the mean prediction error of our models is 5%. Realizing aggregation at nodes significantly reduces energy consumption and avoids hot-spot problem with homogeneous consumptions along the chain. Models give an approximate lifetime of the wireless sensor network and communicating concretes services. They can also be used online by nodes for a self-assessment of their energy consumptions. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - Bearing in mind that dwellings generate a high environmental impact, the aim of this research is to improve their energy efficiency. The incorporation of an insulating layer in the extrados of the building envelope is the most effective way of reducing the transmittance of a facade, eliminating thermal bridges, and optimizing its energy consumption. There is no doubt about the effectiveness of this solution in terms of thermal protection. However, this process collides with the preservation of the original composition of buildings with ornate facades. This article presents a protocol for the rehabilitation of ornate facades of historic buildings through the application of an insulating layer on the outside of the walls. The protocol shows that advanced techniques applied with an integrated approach permit compatibility between energy rehabilitation and the preservation of the original value. In addition to applying strategies of a high technological level, the protocol proposes a reflection upon a balanced intervention on ornamental elements, as well as the relationship between the degree of energy improvement of an ornate facade, and the degree of preservation of the original composition. A methodology is established that combines different avant-guard techniques and systems. These include capturing reality in 3D, the Building Information Model (BIM), monitoring, advanced manufacturing, and active and passive solution simulations. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - The main goal of green building is to provide comfortable life for its residents, while encountering the negative impacts on the surrounding environment. This goal can be achieved by applying effective methodologies throughout the entire life cycle of the building and maintaining an efficient usage of the available energy resources. As part of “building information modeling (BIM),” there are numerous software simulation applications that can be used for analyzing, and modeling energy consumption in all stages of green building, starting from the initial stages of planning and design, up to the final stages of operation and maintenance. In this research work, we conduct a thorough investigation, analysis, and comparison of the performance of most common software applications used for simulating and modeling the energy consumption in green building, and subsequently, the best application is recognized based on unified selection criteria, which include various sets of design parameters and operating conditions. © 2020, Institut Mines-Télécom and Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - The construction sector high energy consumption and GHG emissions lead to the development of easier methodologies to achieve low carbon buildings. Currently, the use of Building Information Modeling (BIM) is growing in the Architecture, Engineering, Construction and Operation (AECO) sector, and it assumes relevance in buildings energy simulation. Therefore, this work aims to explore the potential and limitations of applying BIM to energy management and simulation in the operation life cycle phase of a service building, and comparing it with a specific and customized tool for energy efficiency assessment of public buildings. A service building BIM model was developed in Autodesk Revit showing its utility when used as an asset for storing and organize energy-related data. The add-in Energy Analysis for Autodesk Revit allowed automatically generating the Building Energy Model (BEM) from the BIM model and performing a cloud-based simulation in Autodesk Green Building Studio (GBS). The energy consumption results obtained in GBS were compared with the results obtained with the energy simulation tool ECO.AP developed in the Portuguese National Laboratory of Civil Engineering (LNEC). It was possible to infer that the input limitations of GBS, mainly in HVAC systems customization, compromise the representation and energy performance evaluation of the building under actual operating conditions, making GBS more adequate for early buildings life cycle stages where energy simulation results may support decisions that aim to improve the buildings energy performance during the operation phase. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - In photovoltaic power systems operating under variable atmospheric conditions, the success of maximum power point tracking (MPPT) methods is very important for efficiency. Therefore, many different MPPT methods have been developed in the literature. The voltage-controlled MPPT method is one of the oldest methods that is easy to implement but operates with low efficiency in variable weather conditions. At variable radiation and temperature values, the voltage value that the system must generate in order to capture the MPP point was obtained by modeling the PV system by the system identification. Thus, using only system input and output information, a model was created without the need for system parameters. In this study, system modeling was performed using the Wavenet nonlinear function. The output of the system model gives the reference voltage required to capture the MPP point. Thus, the reference input voltage of the MPPT was made adaptive against changing weather conditions. By using the proposed voltage controlled MPPT method and the other conventional methods such as Incremental Conductance (IC), Perturb and Observe (PO), and Constant Voltage Controller(CVC) methods, various simulations (3 different scenario) were performed in Matlab/Simulink environment. The results obtained from simulations carried out for three different weather conditions were given comparatively. The performance of the proposed method was analyzed in detail at the change points of the temperature and radiation values, and at some other regions. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

TI  - Interoperability and data exchange within BIM platform to evaluate building energy performance and indoor comfort
PY  - 2020

AU  - Sözer, H.
AB  - Most applied strategies during the building design process require careful consideration of indoor air quality and thermal conditions. This requires a detailed analysis involving multi and interdisciplinary efforts during the design process and thus, in turn, manifold interactions among various analysis methods and their simulation tools. An undesired consequence of this activity may be major problems in terms of data clashes and data losses. These difficulties may be overcome by utilizing a three-dimensional (3D) building model that not only includes the building's functional and physical specifications but also incorporates its thermal capacity and environmental dynamics. For this, building information modeling (BIM) can be employed as a base. The interoperability of the programs thus utilized need to be identified and ensued, as this is not yet clearly defined in the literature for these complicated analysis methods. This study thus aims to improve the building design process by developing a method to determine the interoperability of the utilized programs for evaluating a building's energy performance and indoor comfort through the BIM approach. A case study is conducted to verify the applicability of the proposed method and to identify the interoperability limits during the data exchange. To this end, three main analysis models are developed and evaluated. The architecture of the building is developed with the 3D building model as specified by the building's physical conditions; the indoor comfort conditions are developed with the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) of natural ventilation as specified by temperature, humidity, and air velocity; and energy performance is developed with a building energy model specified by the building architecture and its systems. These are then all integrated through a BIM platform. Therefore, the complexity of software integration is eliminated by the BIM-based proposed methodology. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Worldwide, the building sector is responsible for consuming more than 36% of the final global energy and produces 39% of carbon dioxide emissions. Accordingly, sustainable retrofit is an important method to achieve energy reduction and sustainable development. However, the lack of information on retrofit technologies and their benefits trigger stakeholder’s opposition to retrofit actions. The Energy Performance Certificate tool can be used to overcome the knowledge gap and boost energy saving by strengthening its recommendation report with retrofit technologies for energy performance. Therefore, this paper attempts to determine the best retrofit technologies to be highlighted in the Energy Performance Certificate’s recommendation report by considering stakeholder’s opinions. For this purpose, a model based on Quality Function Deployment has been developed. The model analyzes the data regarding stakeholder’s expectations when deciding to retrofit, and the potential retrofit technologies used. To validate the applicability of the proposed model, a case study was conducted in Romania. The findings are expected to contribute to improving the quality of the Energy Performance Certificate, as reflecting stakeholder’s opinions combined with sustainable concepts to achieve significant energy savings. © 2020, © 2020 The Author(s).

AB  - One of the least used aspects of BIM (Building Information Modeling) is the ability to obtain the energy model of the building using the BIM methodology known as BIM 6D. This digital information model allows simulating the real energy behavior of the building and the improvement in the building’s lighting systems, both natural and artificial, in particular daylighting. In this way, the BIM 6D simulation allows us to make design and operation decisions for the building, not only for new buildings that must be, in accordance with current legislation, NZEB (Nearly Zero-Energy Building) but also for the rehabilitation of existing buildings. Particularly in buildings for sanitary use, BIM 6D allows an exhaustive analysis of the energy impact of said rehabilitation, guiding it towards an improvement in energy and light efficiency, which in turn provides greater quality and comfort in the use of the sustainable building. This subject of study is especially important in public buildings for hospital use. Buildings where energy efficiency and comfort, oriented towards optimal and efficient lighting, are two fundamental criteria highly appreciated by patients and citizens in general. Once the energy model of the building has been obtained, it is possible to study and identify possible alternatives to improve energy efficiency and improve lighting, as well as to analyze the possibilities of incorporating other more efficient forms of renewable energy, such as the use of daylight. In this work we can see how applying a set of simulated improvement actions in BIM 6D achieves an energy saving of 50% in general and up to 13% only by acting on lighting systems, allowing the decarbonization of buildings with high energy consumption, such as hospitals, and in turn, will lead to an improvement in the energy certification of these buildings; thus achieving a better and higher quality of habitability, using more efficient forms of lighting and transforming buildings into more sustainable spaces. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - Controlling the selectivity of catalytic reactions is a critical aspect of improving energy efficiency in the chemical industry; thus, predictive models are of key importance. Herein the performance of a heterogeneous, nanoporous Au catalyst is predicted for the complex catalytic self-coupling of the series of C2–C4 alkyl alcohols, based solely on the known kinetics of the elementary steps of the catalytic cycle for methanol coupling, using scaling methods augmented by density functional theory. Notably, a sharp decrease in selectivity for ester formation with increasing molecular weight to favor the aldehyde due to van der Waals interactions of reaction intermediates with the surface was predicted and subsequently verified quantitatively by experiment. Further, the agreement between theory and experiment clearly demonstrates the efficacy of this approach for building a predictive model of catalytic behavior for a homologous set of reactants using a small set of experimental information. © 2020 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

AB  - Extreme weather events become more frequent and severe due to climate change. Although energy efficiency technologies can influence thermal resilience of buildings, they are traditionally studied separately, and their interconnections are rarely quantified. This study developed a methodology of modeling and analysis to provide insights into the nexus of thermal resilience and energy efficiency of buildings. We conducted a case study of a real nursing home in Florida, where 12 patients died during Hurricane Irma in 2017 due to HVAC system power loss, to understand and quantify how passive and active energy efficiency measures (EEMs) can improve thermal resilience to reduce heat-exposure risk of patients. Results show that passive measures of opening windows and doors for natural ventilation, as well as miscellaneous load reduction, are very effective in eliminating the extreme dangerous occasions. However, to maintain safe conditions, active measures such as on-site power generators and thermal storage are also needed. The nursing home was further studied by changing its location to two other cities: San Francisco (mild climate) and Chicago (cold winter and hot summer). Results revealed that the EEMs' impacts on thermal resilience vary significantly by climate and building characteristics. The study also estimated the costs of EEMs to help stakeholders prioritize the measures. Passive measures that may not save energy may greatly improve thermal resilience, and thus should be considered in building design or retrofit. Findings from this study indicate energy efficiency technologies should be evaluated not only by their energy savings performance but also by their influence on a building's resilience to extreme weather events. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - An integrated urban platform is the essential software infrastructure for smart, sustainable and resilient city planning, operation and maintenance. Today such platforms are mostly designed to handle and analyze large and heterogeneous urban data sets from very different domains. Modeling and optimization functionalities are usually not part of the software concepts. However, such functionalities are considered crucial by the authors to develop transformation scenarios and to optimize smart city operation. An urban platform needs to handle multiple scales in the time and spatial domain, ranging from long term population and land use change to hourly or sub-hourly matching of renewable energy supply and urban energy demand. The paper discusses software architecture concepts for data and modeling urban platforms, which allow to analyze and optimize the urban infrastructure with their energy, water and further resources such as food or goods consumption. Building, commerce and industry as well as the transport sector are in the focus of the efficiency and renewable supply analysis. The main driver is to derive zero carbon strategies for cities while including all major sectors of CO2 generation. So far, two software architecture concepts have been implemented and tested, both using a 3D CityGML geometry data model: A workflow management system for city scale building energy modeling using a monthly energy balance calculation method and a micro service orchestration for dynamic building simulation modeling. The GIS based data analysis methodology and building energy workflow modeling method are applied to a case study district in New York City to demonstrate the implementation status and derive CO2 mitigation strategies. The results showed how data gathered from different sources for the relevant sectors can be translated into CO2-emissions. For a district in Brooklyn connected to a large electric substation with electricity monitoring data available, every individual building´s heating and cooling demand was simulated and resulted in a total annual heating demand of 1.72 TWh/a and 0.11 TWh/a of cooling. It could be shown that the building sector cooling demand can by reduced by 63% by a change of set point temperature for cooling and reduced infiltration rate, while reducing the heat demand by 12%. In addition, carbon accounting of the food and wastewater sector was done using the same GIS based modeling framework. The analysis showed that the food related electricity consumption for refrigeration corresponds to about 5% of the overall electricity consumption and requires 2.6 GWh/a for transport. Using food waste in co-digestion of wastewater treatment plants could contribute another 7.4 GWh/a of combined heat and power. Such quantification of demand and energy sources could contribute to prioritize actions for CO2 mitigation strategies in urban areas. © 2020

Understanding the energy use at urban scale will lay the foundation for identification of energy efficiency opportunities to be deployed at speed. China has almost half of global new constructions and plays an important role in building suitability. However, an open source national building energy consumption database is not available in China. To provide data support for building energy consumptions, this paper used a simulation method to develop an urban building energy consumption database for a pilot city in Wuhan, China. First, residential, small, and large office building archetype energy models were created in EnergyPlus to represent typical building energy consumption inWuhan. The baseline reference model simulation results were further validated using survey data from the literature. Second, stochastic simulations were conducted to consider different design parameters and occupants' energy usage intensity scenarios, such as thermal properties of the building envelope, lighting power density, equipment power density, HVAC (heating, ventilation and air conditioning) schedule, etc. A building energy consumption database was generated for typical building archetypes. Third, data-driven regression analysis was conducted to support quick building energy consumption prediction using key highlevel building information inputs. Finally, a web-based urban energy platform and an interface were developed to support further third-party application development. The research is expected to provide fast energy efficiency building design solutions for urban planning, new constructions as well as building retrofits. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - Electric vehicles (EVs) have obtained increasing public interest due to the associated economic and environmental benefits. Recently, studies regarding the economic advantages of adopting EVs as energy storages for commercial/residential buildings are emerging. In fact, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, the industrial sector consumes more energy than all of the other sectors combined, which is about 54% of the world's total delivered energy. The energy consumption pattern in manufacturing facilities is based on production schedules and the heat transfer between machines and the ambient surroundings, thus, differs greatly from commercial/residential buildings. However, little research attention has been given to analyse the synergies of integrating EVs and manufacturing facilities to improve energy efficiency. To fill this research gap, in this study, a comprehensive model is established to evaluate the economic and environmental performance of an energy sharing system that consists of the EVs, power grid, and manufacturing facilities (EPM) under Time-of-Use (TOU) electricity tariff. The model is formulated as a mixed integer nonlinear programming format by considering practical production schedules, heat exchange between machines and ambient surroundings, as well as the heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) system. The case study results indicate that the presented EPMenergy sharing system has great potential to reduce energy cost and CO2 emissions. In addition, compared to the results from winter scenarios, it is shown that more cost savings can be achieved in summer days. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - In the European framework, there is a strong drive to develop integrated approaches aimed at understanding and improving the energy behavior of public historic buildings within urban contexts. However, the examples already provided tend to address the issue from mono-disciplinary perspectives, losing the opportunity for a coordinated view. The research suggests a methodology to reach the definition of a three-dimensional database, which incorporates spatial models and energy information, with the final goal of merging heterogeneous information that is useful to interpret the overall framework and to design sustainable development scenarios. The platform achieves GIS (Geographic Information System) and BIM (Building Information Modeling) integration by using the CityGML data model, for supporting multi-scale analyses without break of continuity, ranging from urban to building level. The discussion combines the applicative case with the theoretical background, deepening the role of a solid knowledge framework as a basis for sustainable interventions on public historic buildings. To better explain and test the methodology, a case study on the University built heritage of Pavia is presented and three possible outputs deriving from the database are discussed. The example demonstrates the strength of the approach, which is able to provide a variety of results coming from a unique source of information, ensuring coherence and unambiguousness at all levels of investigation. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - The impacts of climate change such as extreme heat waves are exacerbated in cities where most of the world's population live. Quantifying urbanization impacts on ambient air temperatures (Tair) has relevance for human health risk, building energy use efficiency, vector-borne disease control and urban biodiversity. Remote sensing of urban climate has been focused on land surface temperature (LST) due to a scarcity of data on Tair which is usually interpolated at 1 km resolution. We assessed the efficacy of mapping hyperlocal Tair (spatial resolutions of 10–30 m) over Oslo, Norway, by integrating Sentinel, Landsat and LiDAR data with crowd-sourced Tair measurements from 1310 private weather stations during 2018. Using Random Forest regression modelling, we found that annual mean, daily maximum and minimum Tair can be mapped with an average RMSE of 0.52 °C (R2 = 0.5), 1.85 °C (R2 = 0.05) and 1.46 °C (R2 = 0.33), respectively. Mapping accuracy decreased sharply with &lt;250 weather stations (approx. 1 station km−2) and remote sensing data averaged within a 100-500 m buffer zone around each station maximized accuracy. Further, models performed best outside of summer months when the spatial variation in temperatures were low and wind velocities were high. Finally, accuracies were not evenly distributed over space and we found the lowest mapping errors in the local climate zone characterized by compact lowrise buildings which are most relevant to city residents. We conclude that this method is transferable to other cities given there was little difference (0.02 °C RMSE) between models trained on open- (satellite and terrain) vs closed-source (LiDAR) remote sensing data. These maps can provide a complement to and validation of traditional urban canopy models and may assist in identifying hyperlocal hotspots and coldspots of relevance to urban planners. © 2020 The Authors

AB  - The selection of cost-effective components of the building envelope plays a significant role in a sustainable building design solution. Therefore, in terms of effective decision-making, it is important to have a complete insight into construction and running costs throughout the lifespan of the building. A systematic building information modelling (BIM) approach as a new trend in the innovative approaches in the construction (AECO) industry provides appropriate support for improvement of environmental assessments. Our study presents a new approach to automated/semi-automated comprehensive energy and the whole life-cycle cost analysis of building envelope components using BIM, and, as such, it represents a novelty for Advanced Construction Project Management. It focuses on the sequence of steps required for evaluation of energy and economic assessment, from the basic 3D BIM model, through the energy and cost analysis, to the final evaluation and decision-making. The energy balance was calculated with dynamic simulation, the results of which formed the basis for the cost analysis. Economic assessment of construction and operating costs was performed by implementation of the cost-optimal methodology. Our proposed approach contributes to the environmental assessment of building envelope components throughout the life cycle and includes the economic valuation. The applicability of the systematic approach in our case study considered 24 different variants of building envelope components at three different U-values, namely U0 = 0.28W/m2K for external wall, U0 = 0.20W/m2K for roof, U1 = 0.15W/m2K and U2 = 0.10W/m2K. Sophisticated project BIM management software was used for the economic evaluation of all elements of the life-cycle costs (LCC). In summary, the main contribution of this approach is provision of a comprehensive and simple insight into all costs in a transparent way, because a 5D BIM model allows for optimal decision-making on appropriate energy and cost-efficient envelope components. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - The Italian building stock consists of buildings mainly constructed until the mid-20th century using pre-industrial construction techniques. These buildings require energy refurbishment that takes into account the preservation of their architectural heritage. In this view, this work studies an innovative integrated modelling and simulation framework consisting of the implementation of Historical Building Information Modeling (HBIM) for the energy retrofit of historical buildings with renewable geothermal HVAC system. To this aim, the field case study is part of a medieval complex in Central Italy (Perugia), as representative ancient rural offshore architecture in the European countryside. The system involves of a ground source heat pump, a water tank for thermal-energy storage connected to a low-temperature radiant system, and an air-handling unit. The building heating energy performance, typically influenced by thermal inertia in historical buildings, when coupled to the novel HVAC system, is comparatively assessed against a traditional scenario implementing a natural-gas boiler, and made inter-operative within the HBIM ad hoc platform. Results show that the innovative renewable energy system provides relevant benefits while preserving minor visual and architectural impact within the historical complex, and also in terms of both energy saving, CO2 emissions offset, and operation costs compared to the traditional existing system. The integrated HBIM approach may effectively drive the path toward regeneration and re-functioning of heritage in Europe. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - This paper investigates the influence of a stochastic variation of both energy and economic parameters in an optimization loop applied to a refurbished social housing building. Usually, energy and economic optimization procedures rely on the results of an underlying numerical deterministic model which influences both energy gains and economic figures. However, an analyst must always face the random variation of input and parameter data. The unknown data can represent poor initial information or data that can change in a long time; this is the case of fuel cost and economic indexes in particular. This paper deals with both problems for building refurbishment optimization, the former related to the initial state of a building, and the latter to the energy cost variability. Reliability analysis considers a stochastic variation of parameters looking for solutions that incorporate a risk level; in this case, it deals with optimization objectives related to different impacts on economic, environmental and health aspects. The considered building represents a social house, and the energy reduction measures involve the application of internal insulation layers to the walls and the replacement of existing windows with more efficient ones. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - This study discusses a numerical study that was developed to optimize the ventilation system in a power substation prior to its installation. We established a multiobjective particle swarm optimizer to identify the best approach for simultaneously improving, first, the ventilation performance considering the most appropriate inlet size and outlet openings and second, the reduction of the synthetic noise of the ventilation and power consumption from the exhaust fan equipment and its operation. The study used building information modeling to construct indoor and outdoor models of the substation building and verified the overall performance using ANSYS FLUENT 18.0 software to simulate the air velocity and air temperature distribution within the building. Results show that the exhaust fan of the B1F cable finishing room and the 23 kV gas insulated switchgear (GIS) room optimize the reduction of horsepower by approximately 1 Hp and 0.5 Hp. The combined noise is reduced by 4 dBA and 2 dBA; the exhaust fan runs for 30 min, and the two equipment rooms can cool down by 2.9 °C and 1.7 °C, respectively. Therefore, it is confirmed that the MOPSO algorithm provides a more energy-efficient and environmentally friendly building ventilation environment. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - The development of new climate change policies has increased the motivation to reduce energy use in buildings, as reflected by a stringent regulatory landscape. The construction industry is expected to adopt new methods and strategies to address such requirements, focusing primarily on reducing energy demand, improving process efficiency and reducing carbon emissions. However, the realisation of these emerging requirements has been constrained by the highly fragmented nature of the industry, which is often portrayed as involving a culture of adversarial relationships and risk avoidance, which is exacerbated by a linear workflow. Recurring problems include low process efficiency, delays and construction waste. Building information modelling (BIM) provides a unique opportunity to enhance building energy efficiency (EE) and to open new pathways towards a more digitalised industry and society. BIM has the potential to reduce (a) waste and carbon emissions, (b) the endemic performance gap, (c) in-use energy and (d) the total lifecycle impact. BIM also targets to improve the whole supply chain related to the design, construction as well as the management and use of the facility. However, the construction workforce is required to upgrade their skills and competencies to satisfy new requirements for delivering BIM for EE. Currently, there is a real gap between the industry expectations for employees and current training and educational programmes. There is also a set of new requirements and expectations that the construction industry needs to identify and address in order to deliver more informed BIM for EE practices. This paper provides an in-depth analysis and gap identification pertaining to the skills and competencies involved in BIM training for EE. Consultations and interviews have been used as a method to collect requirements, and a portfolio of use cases have been created and analysed to better understand existing BIM practices and to determine current limitations and gaps in BIM training. The results show that BIM can contribute to the digitalisation of the construction industry in Europe with adapted BIM training and educational programmes to deliver more informed and adapted energy strategies. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - Integrated energy systems (IESs) are composed of multiple heterogeneous subsystems, i.e., electrical power system, natural gas system, and district heating system (DHS), which endow the whole system with excellent performance in overall efficiency and renewable energy utilization. The paper aims to offer a concise and analytical model for the thermal dynamic characteristics (i.e., thermal inertia) of the district heating network (DHN) and buildings to facilitate the analysis, planning, and operation of IESs. Firstly, an equivalent start network is introduced for modeling the radial DHN, and a synchronous response model is proposed for buildings to approximate the optimal response of heat load. Secondly, the thermal inertia aggregation model (TIAM) is proposed, which offers an accurate DHN and buildings model for the planning and operation of IESs. Finally, some properties of the TIAM are derived to reveal its potential in general applications such as analysis and evaluation. Simulation results of different scale systems demonstrate the performance of the proposed model and reveal its advantages in the computational efficiency and sensitive information protection of DHN. © 1969-2012 IEEE.

TI  - Comparison of local solar radiation parameters with data from a typical meteorological year
PY  - 2020
AU  - Rudniak, J.
AB  - Precise determination of local climate characteristics has a huge impact on predicting the efficiency of solar energy systems, as well as simulations of energy demand of buildings. Among many weather data, solar conditions are a very relevant parameter, and the solar irradiance is an important part of a Typical Meteorological Year. TMY sets are created by averaging and modeling data, which unfortunately significantly differs from real conditions. The article presents a comparison of locally measured values of solar irradiance, with particular emphasis on the summer period, in relation to TMY data developed in Poland and TMY data from European Photovoltaic Geographical Information System databases. Significant differences between the data were found. The percentage share of solar irradiance in the range of 600 ÷ 1300 W/m2 in summer, for each of the three TMY PVGIS was 19.86%, 23.75%, 22.50% respectively, while for TMY PL only 8.89%. In the measurements for this range in the summer of 2018 this share was 25.14%, and 20.39% in 2006. Despite the fact that TMY databases include average values of individual parameters, TMY PVGIS data do not differ much from those obtained in summer measurements, which contain also extreme values. In addition, the structure similarity indicator used to compare the data sets confirmed these relationships. This suggests the need to update the TMY PL database, for specific locations, especially in relation to the summer season. The analysis also concerned local sunshine duration in various time intervals as well as factors limiting the availability of solar radiation. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Continual, safe, secure, reliable, and efficient delivery of high-quality power is the main goal of the Smart Grid (SG) defined as the energy network integrated with the novel Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs). This paper focuses on the development of communication system models to be used for voltage profile monitoring and power losses estimation in SG. Existing research on communication technologies in SG is briefly overviewed with the main focus on Cloud and Fog computing approaches. With rising numbers of smart devices in SG, the amount of measurement data rapidly increases demanding more efficient communication architectures. Two communication architectures are selected and modeled with the main goal to support real-time monitoring and data analysis in SG. Cloud- and Cloud-Fog-based approaches are proposed and analyzed as communication system models for SG real-time monitoring. Posting immense quantities of data on Cloud commonly represents a serious challenge due to latency, locality, and network congestion. The best approach to overcome Cloud challenges is to perform decentralized and intelligent processing closer to the location where data are being generated, which is known as Fog computing. A MATLAB/Simulink-based model of a well-known IEEE test grid topology is modified to support real-time communication with open source IoT platform ThingSpeak used for Cloud computing. Fog computing layer is conceptualized to be located in the main distribution substation and it is modeled by MATLAB function blocks. The proposed modeling procedure is given step by step to highlight the most important building blocks necessary for creating a combined power and communication system model capable of providing meaningful data related to SG monitoring. The developed model is tested using simulation events common in distribution networks. The simulation results of Cloud and Cloud-Fog approaches for voltage profile monitoring and power losses calculation in SG have confirmed the benefits of the Cloud-Fog-based approach. © 2019

TI  - An energy-saving oriented air balancing method for demand controlled ventilation systems with branch and black-box model
PY  - 2020
AU  - Cui, C.
AU  - Zhang, X.
AU  - Cai, W.
AB  - This paper proposes an energy-saving oriented air balancing method based on a branch and black-box (B2) model for multi-zone demand controlled ventilation (DCV) systems. The proposed method can achieve accurate air flow control in each zone, which avoids unnecessary energy consumption caused by over-ventilation. The operating procedures of the proposed method are as follows: Building the B2 model for the DCV system → Predicting the terminal static pressures under the given zone design flow values → Determining the damper angles of each zone based on the static pressure predictions. In the proposed air balancing method, the basic modelling unit is the duct branch, instead of the internal fittings in the previous model-based air balancing method. Therefore, the proposed method does not need to know the complicated fitting information (e.g., elbows, transitions, dampers, etc.,) in its modelling process and therefore becomes much simpler. In addition, the complexity of the proposed B2 model is also greatly reduced since it is independent with the fitting numbers and does not need to calculate the fitting loss coefficients. Furthermore, the radial basis function (RBF) kernel is also utilized in the proposed method to guarantee the air balancing accuracy. Compared with the existing air balancing methods, the proposed method is more efficient and effective in practice. In the lab, the proposed air balancing method was validated on a real DCV system of 5 zones under various design flow conditions. The experimental results verified the effectiveness of the proposed method on both the air balancing control accuracy and the energy saving ability. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Political or economic attempts to mitigate climate change by increasing fossil fuel prices lead to and an increase in energy poverty, i.e., social effects. The ideal solution would be to combine modernisation activities in terms of energy use in cities with sustainable strategies and redevelopment policies. The article's purpose is to estimate the potential for reducing energy consumption depending on socioeconomic factors (household standard and its location in the city) based on built-in scenarios and searching for the optimal way of conducting development policy at the local level. This assumption enables the implementation of the European Union climate policy. To this aim, modelling based on real and estimated data on the diversity of energy consumption in the structure of a medium-sized city in Europe (Zielona Góra) carried out. While creating scenarios, there used a modelling method based on radial artificial neural networks, which map the input set into the output set by matching many individual approximating functions to setpoints. This approach works well for data whose geolocation is in the city quarters. As a result of the simulations, the minimum and maximum achievable energy saving potential for low-intensity buildings in the quarters was estimated, taking into account the possibilities of investing in renewable energy by individual households. The observations included in the article may be relevant to other regions that are interested in reducing the energy consumption of buildings and pollution emissions from the cities. This is particularly important for the regions of Europe that benefit from the financial support of the European Union (including local development programmes based on financing European priority axes for economic development). © 2020 The Authors

AB  - The global shift towards embodied carbon reduction in the building sector has indicated the need for a detailed analysis of environmental impacts across the whole lifecycle of buildings. The environmental impact of heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems has rarely been studied in detail. Most of the published studies are based on assumptions and rule of thumb techniques. In this study, the requirements and methods to perform a detailed life cycle assessment (LCA) for HVAC systems based on building information modelling (BIM) are assessed and framed for the first time. The approach of linking external product data information to objects using visual programming language (VPL) is tested, and its benefits over the existing workflows are presented. The detailed BIM model of a newly built office building in Switzerland is used as a case study. In addition, detailed project documentation is used to ensure the plausibility of the calculated impact. The LCA results show that the embodied impact of the HVAC systems is three times higher than the targets provided by the Swiss Energy Efficiency Path (SIA 2040). Furthermore, it is shown that the embodied impact of HVAC systems lies in the range of 15-36% of the total embodied impact of office buildings. Nevertheless, further research and similar case studies are needed to provide a robust picture of the embodied environmental impact of HVAC systems. The results could contribute to setting stricter targets in line with the vision of decarbonization of the building sector. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - Building Information Modeling (BIM) is increasingly used throughout the facility’s life cycle for various applications, such as design, construction, facility management, and maintenance. For existing buildings, the geometry of as-built BIM is often constructed using dense, three dimensional (3D) point clouds data obtained with laser scanners. Traditionally, as-built BIM systems do not contain the material and textural information of the buildings’ elements. This paper presents a semi-automatic method for generation of material and texture rich as-built BIM. The method captures and integrates material and textural information of building elements into as-built BIM using thermal infrared sensing (TIS). The proposed method uses TIS to capture thermal images of the interior walls of an existing building. These images are then processed to extract the interior walls using a segmentation algorithm. The digital numbers in the resulted images are then transformed into radiance values that represent the emitted thermal infrared radiation. Machine learning techniques are then applied to build a correlation between the radiance values and the material type in each image. The radiance values were used to extract textural information from the images. The extracted textural and material information are then robustly integrated into the as-built BIM providing the data needed for the assessment of building conditions in general including energy efficiency, among others. © 2020 Techno-Press, Ltd.

AB  - With current efforts to increase energy efficiency and reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of buildings in the operational phase, the share of embedded energy (EE) and embedded GHG emissions is increasing. In early design stages, chances to influence these factors in a positive way are greatest, but very little and vague information about the future building is available. Therefore, this study introduces a building information modeling (BIM)-based method to analyze the contribution of the main functional parts of buildings to find embedded energy demand and GHG emission reduction potentials. At the same time, a sensitivity analysis shows the variance in results due to the uncertainties inherent in early design to avoid misleadingly precise results. The sensitivity analysis provides guidance to the design team as to where to strategically reduce uncertainties in order to increase precision of the overall results. A case study shows that the variability and sensitivity of the results differ between environmental indicators and construction types (wood or concrete). The case study contribution analysis reveals that the building's structure is the main contributor of roughly half of total GHG emissions if the main structural material is reinforced concrete. Exchanging reinforced concrete for a wood structure reduces total GHG emissions by 25%, with GHG emissions of the structure contributing 33% and windows 30%. Variability can be reduced systematically by first reducing vagueness in geometrical and technical specifications and subsequently in the amount of interior walls. The study shows how a simplified and fast BIM-based calculation provides valuable guidance in early design stages. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - Demand side management (DSM) plays a critical role in dealing with power system reliability as one of the main challenges of generating energy in stand-alone residential buildings. This paper introduces a new effective approach of DSM based on predetermined hourly generation and time-varying tariffs to enhance the reliability and quality of a stand-alone energy system. This research focus on two main novelties: 1) analyzing data via clustering method to improve the efficiency and accuracy of DSM, and 2) a state-of-the-art modeling framework DSM for a stand-alone residential building. Looking at first novelty, the well-known linkage-ward clustering method is used for defining time-varying tariffs and in the second novelty the mixed integer linear programming (MILP) formulates the power system components, load management and objective function considering user's priority and convenience to improve the reliability of a stand-alone energy system. The proposed method outperforms DSM in hybrid power systems consisting of photovoltaic, wind turbines, and energy storage systems. To illustrate the efficiency of this strategy, the proposed DSM is applied to a stand-alone building located in Sistan and Baluchistan province of Iran as an experimental case. Considering four different case studies that include a battery energy storage system and electric vehicle, the results reveal that the power system reliability and energy supplying quality are significantly improved by utilizing the aforementioned DSM. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Architectural building design practic in hot climate regions has high-priority in the design process. Thus, selecting appropriate Architectural Design Features (ADFs) at the early design stage provides significant opportunities to control heat flows, maximize building energy performance, reduce excessive energy consumption cost, and preserve a comfortable temperature for occupants. In this research, an Architectural-Based Energy Impact Scoring System (AEISS) was developed based on inputs from 10 expert architects, and it consists of seven ADFs and 40 multiple design options. The proposed system provides a simple decision scoring system for designers to evaluate design alternatives and optimize the energy consumption of buildings in the early design phase. A simple user-friendly program for the AEISS was developed to assist the designers in generating the design alternatives scores. Energy simulation analyses were performed to validate the applicability of the proposed AEISS by integrating 3-D BIM models of three different design alternatives of a residential building in Saudi Arabia with Ecotect analysis software. A detailed analysis was performed to evaluate the energy impact of the selected ADFs and to compare the alternatives in terms of energy consumptions and cost-efficiency. The simulation results proved that the proposed AEISS gave responsive results and is capable of providing stakeholders with the optimum decision to select the design alternative with high energy performance and low consumption cost. © 2020

AB  - Building energy efficiency (BEE) is regarded as the key sector in the world for addressing climate change and energy problems, since buildings consume around one-third of global energy and produce a substantial amount of greenhouse gas emissions. It is important to utilise BEE standards (BEESs) to ensure that cost-effective energy efficiency opportunities are incorporated into new and existing buildings. A key question is how the actual performance of BEESs can be measured so that they are developed in a more sustainable way. An effective method that can evaluate BEESs from both quantitative and qualitative perspectives is provided, and it fulfils a dual step: (a) determining a BEES evaluation indicator system, including technological, economical and social indicators, by identification, correction and selection; and (b) establishing the BEES evaluation model: a fuzzy synthetic evaluation model based on the information entropy theory with the analytic hierarchy process. The developed BEES evaluation model and the case study of China's 'Design standard for energy efficiency of public buildings' could provide a comprehensive framework to understand the energy efficiency performance of BEESs in China. The results will help improve the management of BEESs and ensure more sustainable building practice. © 2020 ICE Publishing: All rights reserved.

AB  - The early stages of building design involve the consideration of different design variants and their assessment regarding various performance criteria including energy consumption and costs. During the design process, the involved experts from different disciplines frequently exchange building information to develop a design that satisfies the project's requirements and objectives. In the course of this iterative process, the building design evolves throughout multiple refinement stages. At the same time, different variants are developed. In BIM-based projects, the maturity of the design information provided by the model is expressed by the notion of Level of development (LOD). So far, however, there is no method to formally define the information requirements of a LOD. In particular, there are no means for expressing the uncertainty involved with the provided information. By contrast, despite the insufficient information available in early design stages, a BIM model appears precise and certain. This situation leads to false assumptions and model evaluations, for example, in the case of energy efficiency calculations or structural analysis. Hence, this paper presents an overview of a set of approaches that were developed to alleviate and preserve the consistency of the designed solutions. The approach includes the development of a multi-LOD meta-model, which allows one to explicitly describe the LOD requirements of each building component type incorporating the possible uncertainties, e.g. concerning the building dimensions. On the basis of this multi-LOD model, methods for evaluating a building design's performance regarding the building's structure and life cycle energy performance are proposed that take the defined uncertainties into account. To support the management of design variants in one consistent model, a graph-based approach is introduced. Finally, a minimized communication protocol is described to facilitate the workflow and communicate the evaluation results for supporting the decision-making process. © 2020 The author(s).

AB  - Development of low thermal conductivity and high strength building materials is an emerging strategy to solve the heavy energy consumption of buildings. This study develops sustainable alkali activated materials (AAMs) for structural members from waste expanded polystyrene (EPS) beads and reduced graphene oxide (rGO) to simultaneously meet the thermal insulation and mechanical requirements of building energy conservation. It was found that the thermal conductivity of AAMs with 80 vol. % EPS and 0.04 wt. % rGO (E8-G4) decreased by 74% compared to the AAMs without EPS and rGO (E0). The 28-day compressive and flexural strengths of E8-G4 increased by 29.8% and 26.5% with the addition of 80 vol. % EPS and 0.04 wt. % rGO, compared to the sample with 80 vol. % EPS without rGO (E8). In terms of compressive strength, thermal conductivity, and cost, the efficiency index of E8-G4 was higher than those of other materials. A building model made from AAMs was designed using building information modeling (BIM) tools to simulate energy consumption, and 31.78% of total energy consumption (including heating and cooling) was saved in the building operation period in Harbin City, China. Hence, AAMs made of waste EPS beads and rGO can realize the structural and functional integrated application in the future. © 2020 by the authors.

TI  - Automatic Detection of Geometric Errors in Space Boundaries of IFC-BIM Models Using Monte Carlo Ray Tracing Approach
PY  - 2020
AU  - Ying, H.
AU  - Lee, S., A.m.asce
AB  - In Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) building information modeling (BIM), the objectified concept of a space boundary (SB) provides a means to define building space geometries with surface entities. Such building-geometry definitions are widely used for various engineering applications such as energy simulation, lighting analysis, and facility management. However, quality issues (i.e., geometric and nongeometric issues) of SBs have been widely reported, which makes it necessary to validate the SBs before retrieving them from IFC models for relevant applications. Unfortunately, there is still a lack of reliable mechanisms/tools to automatically evaluate the quality of SBs, especially the geometric quality. This study proposes a Monte Carlo ray tracing approach to automatically detect geometric errors in SBs. The approach checks SBs space by space in terms of whether each space is correctly bounded by its SBs. The geometric errors in the set of SBs of a space that the approach can detect include gaps, overhangs, and overlaps between SBs as well as incorrect surface normal directions of SBs. To accelerate the ray tracing process in the approach, the axis-aligned bounding box (AABB) tree is implemented to spatially index SBs of each space. The approach is evaluated with extensive performance tests in terms of robustness and efficiency. The results show that the approach can robustly and efficiently detect all four types of geometric errors even in extreme cases and that the AABB tree helps speed up the approach significantly for large-scale IFC models with many complex spaces. © 2019 American Society of Civil Engineers.

TI  - Simulating a residential building stock to support regional efficiency policy

AU  - Azevedo, I.L.
AB  - Building simulation tools are seeing growing use in the residential sector due to a combination of increased interest in building energy performance, more user-friendly software packages, and decreasing computing power requirements. These tools are now being applied in batch simulations, where large numbers of homes are simulated at once to understand existing building stock energy consumption and potential energy efficiency improvements to make to those stocks. As these types of applications grow, attention is needed to ensure that simulation inputs and outputs are handled with an appropriate understanding of the uncertainties involved. In this paper, we use a batch simulation tool to translate energy audit records of 296 existing single-family homes in Pennsylvania into EnergyPlus building simulation models. We compare the results of these simulations to actual metered electricity use data from these homes, representative device-level data, and local utility data to better understand the abilities and limits of such modeling practices. Results show that while batch simulations are capable of producing accurate estimates of the energy consumption of a large number of homes, many more homes had their energy consumption overestimated than underestimated, resulting in a significant net overestimate for the sample as a whole. When results are scaled up to the utility level, simulation accuracy varies by utility with net overestimates ranging from around 15% to 25%. Comparisons of individual simulation results to metered consumption identify electric space heating systems as the source of much of this error. This highlights the importance of gathering accurate, detailed information on these systems to generate reliable simulation results. NREL has recently released a batch simulation tool called ResStock that takes a more statistically robust approach to simulating representative archetype homes as opposed to actual existing homes. The results of this study suggest that the type of probabilistic treatment of building characteristics underlying that tool will provide more meaningful results than trying to simulate actual buildings. With additional validation measures similar to those used in this study, ResStock can likely be used to reliably estimate baseline energy consumption and quantify efficiency savings opportunities and can serve as a valuable decision-making tool for state, local, and utility efficiency program designers. © 2019

AB  - Understanding the thermal performance of building envelopes and of their components is a critical issue under energy saving and sustainability points of view. High performance buildings are commonly characterized by passive solutions able to avoid overheating during summertime or to take advantage of solar radiation during wintertime. This study provides an experimental investigation of the thermal performance of a refurbished building which was re-designed aiming at high performance from both an active and passive point of view. The building envelope was investigated, examining the influence of the external shading devices by means of in-situ measurements and introducing an index for the evaluation of the shielding system efficiency. The index was tested by means of numerical simulations and measured data, providing information about the efficiency of the solar shading device in terms of glazing external surface temperature reduction. It was found that the shielding system allows to achieve a reduction in terms of incoming thermal energy equal to 38.7% during summertime. The index could be used both for opaque and transparent building components covered by a shading device, independently by the shape of the shading system or by the thermal performance of the component. The index could be therefore useful for both solar shading devices producers and for practitioners for preliminary design evaluations. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - There is increasing recognition, both in the literature and from policy-makers, of the influence that operations personnel have over the energy efficiency of large complex buildings and the potential to save energy by providing them with clear and timely feedback. An implicit but poorly founded assumption built into most studies of energy efficiency feedback is that participants have a goal to save energy. Often this is not true and even among those who seek to achieve savings, there is much variability in how competing goals are prioritized. In this study, operators of 110 large office buildings received daily feedback informing them about their buildings’ energy efficiency compared with an “expected” (baseline) level determined by reference to a statistical model that normalized for weather and other factors outside of their control. Variances between expected and actual performance gave them signals about the impact of their actions on energy use. After a period, the focus of the daily messages was switched for 60 of the operators from a baseline profile to the “best” normalized performance observed previously. The introduction of this daily “target” profile was directly associated with additional savings. It was noted that engagement with the daily feedback increased, even though participants had no role in target setting. This study has implications for the design of information feedback methods for building operators and suggests that by giving them an awareness of the divergence between their building’s performance and its efficiency improvement potential, a positive spiral of increasing energy efficiency, expertise, and engagement can emerge. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - For several years, Model Predictive Control (MPC) is depicted in the literature as a promising way to increase buildings’ energy efficiency during operation. This model-based control technique uses the optimal control theory to provide a constraint compliant, anticipative control, maximizing performance criteria. However, building and calibrating a reliable model for a real application is difficult, costly and time-consuming. Indeed, it requires hard expert work to retrieve all the building's data and tune the corresponding model. This prevents MPC to be widespread in Building Management Systems. In this paper, we propose a MPC formulation where all the optimization problems included in a MPC strategy (calibration, estimation, optimal control) are performed efficiently using gradient-based techniques and adjoint-based gradient computations. This formulation relies on an automated “white-box” modeling technique (with partial-differential equations) using Building Information Model (BIM - using gbXML standard here) files parsing. We also show that making extensive use of adjoint models in MPC opens opportunities for fast sensitivity analysis, which can, for instance, help to choose which parameters to calibrate. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Earlier emission peak and higher reduction rate after the peak are crucial for China's domestic low-carbon energy transformations and the 2 °C global climate target. However, much remains to be resolved concerning long-term sectoral and regional coping strategies. In this study, we developed a spatial downscaling framework to identify the roles played by different provinces and sectors in promoting early emission peak, and the spatiotemporal variations of city-level reduction potentials for the building sector by coupling an integrated assessment model with openly available information. Simulations show that peaking emissions five years earlier means an additional 12.5 Gt CO2 emission cut during 2015–2035 and building sector needs to increase renewable penetration to 22% and further improve emission efficiency by 12%, which are both greater than other end use sectors. More developed eastern regions would peak earlier than national target and some central cities are expected to double their per capita building emissions. While for the less developed northern and western regions to peak on time it is necessary that the gap of CO2 emission intensity between these cities and national average narrow down from 9.8t/thousand RMB in 2020 to 5.9t/thousand RMB in 2030. © 2019

TI  - Incorporating an agent-based decision tool to better understand occupant pathways to GHG reductions in NYC buildings
PY  - 2020
AU  - Khansari, N.
AU  - Hewitt, E.
AB  - A number of cities globally have developed ambitious goals to reduce greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs), and New York City has publicly committed to reducing emissions 80% by 2050 (80 × 50). While physical infrastructure is important, cities can gain important insights through information about human behavior, as people are the end users of buildings, transportation, and other physical assets. In this paper, we present a simplistic, pilot agent-based model (ABM) for New York City with projections about the city's potential for reaching the 80 × 50 goal in the building sector. Importantly, the ABM models occupant choices about technology adoption to predict the prevalence of green buildings in coming years. We find that even though traditional building types are slow to transition, CO2 production still decreases substantially over the forecast interval. Traditional buildings begin to slow their dominance in the model pathways by approximately 10 years into the forecast. Although the ABM presented here relies on simplistic assumptions about human agents and brings a high level of uncertainty, it presents a useful pilot tool to begin to understand system-level impacts from micro-level actions of households and individuals, and provides vast potential for future use of ABMs for this task. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - To facilitate sustainable carbon management on the city scale, estimating carbon emissions is necessary for determining carbon reduction targets. Although many studies have focused on mitigating GHG emission through industrial sector optimization and energy efficiency improvement, limited research was conducted to reduce carbon emission based on spatial planning. This paper proposes a comprehensive carbon emission estimation framework based on GIS technology with open data. It presents the spatial distribution of carbon emission on the city scale. The sectors of carbon emissions are mainly attributed to buildings, transportation, vegetation, and residence. Statistic data was applied to estimate the carbon emission in buildings and residence sectors. Transport carbon emission was calculated through a bottom-up method with the support of the logistic regression model and spatial microsimulation. Carbon sequestration of vegetation was estimated by remote sensing technology. Eindhoven was employed as a case study to verify the feasibility of the framework. The results clearly illustrate the carbon balance in association with land use patterns. The new framework can be used to analyze the impact of urban spatial planning on carbon emission. The estimation results can also apply to urban form components (land use, buildings types, and road network) optimization and environmental assessment. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Stations-oriented indoor localization (SOIL): A BIM-Based occupancy schedule modeling system
PY  - 2020
AU  - Yoo, W.
AU  - Kim, H.
AU  - Shin, M.
AB  - This research presents a new occupancy schedule modeling system in a building information modeling (BIM) environment called stations-oriented indoor localization (SOIL). Occupant monitoring, data collection, and analysis are the main challenges when estimating occupancy patterns, especially in large-scale buildings. SOIL utilizes existing network infrastructure (Wi-Fi) and a clustering method to collect and sort occupancy data. These clusters are then mapped onto a BIM model to generate room-level occupancy schedules. In this research, the SOIL system was tested for 10 weekdays on 26 subjects and two operation scenarios in an educational building that included three office spaces and one open studio space. The results show that the SOIL system was able to detect indoor occupants' room-level locations with a 93% level of accuracy, and efficiently generate occupancy schedules in a BIM environment. The main contribution of this SOIL system is the development of a BIM-integrated occupant localization system using existing network infrastructure, a process that has great potential to save energy and assist in the efficient management of a building's renovation, construction, and operation. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Building Information Modelling (BIM) is the application of à computer-based model to analyse building design, material and its operation. By applying BIM into construction industry, designers are able to evaluate the level of sustain ability of their design. In addition, BIM helps building professionals to have a realistic full life cycle assessment of a building in early design stage and conduct the energy analysis even before a building is build. Energy performance evaluation report generated by BIM through software such as ArchiCAD is capable to aid the building professionals towards designing a sustainable building. Reduction on energy consumption of one building can beachieved through many ways. For instance, by selecting a suitable material for building opening, façade as well as selecting efficient appliances/equipment, a building could reduce its energy consumption. In this research, the ground floor of the Chancellery building in Universiti Malaya (UM) is modelled and used as a reference block. The effect of the existing glazing materials and type of lighting (Ao) towards the building energy performance are analysed. Alternatively, a better option of glazing materials and efficient lighting (Bo) are proposed onto the same reference block. The finding encompasses three different aspect of energy efficiency i.e. energy consumption, energy cost and carbone mission from both the existing building design as well as the alternative combination. The alternative combination had proved that an efficient and proper building material and design selection could lead to energy and cost saving as well as the reduction of carbone mission release from a building. In this case, the results shown that the effect of each aspect is 11%, 14% and 14% respectively. Methods of minimizing the utilization of energy in office buildings are presented as well. © 2019 SERSC.

AB  - The energy performance of buildings directive requires from the European Union Member States to ensure that by 31 December 2020 all new buildings are nearly zero-energy buildings (NZEBs) and after 31 December 2018, new buildings occupied/owned by the public authorities should also have the NZEB performance. The large-scale deployment of NZEBs represents a challenge for all the stakeholders involved in the construction sector, where the lack of adequate competences is identified as one of the main obstacles. This article aims to provide a solution to overcome the deficient competences related to NZEB to increase them by using roadmaps derived from Horizon projects – Fit-to-NZEB and Net-UBIEP. Fit-to-NZEB aims to increase the knowledge of architecture, engineering and construction engineers and workers in deep energy retrofit through the education in European qualifications framework levels 3–7, while Net-UBIEP seeks to develop the schemes for using building information modelling (BIM) throughout the whole building life cycle to increase energy performance. The results from both projects show that it is inevitable to act soon to make the energy efficiency targets possible to fulfil. The integrated design process and strengthen control on the construction site should be carried out perfectly as they are the most critical parts in delivering NZEBs and all this managed by BIM to minimise information loss and to improve the design of details. To achieve this, professional competences of all the stakeholders in delivering NZEBs must be improved which could be done by implementing the knowledge from these projects. © 2020 Gumbarević et al., published by Sciendo.

PY  - 2020
AU  - Chadoulos, S.

AU  - Polyzos, G.C.
AB  - Consumers lie at the epicenter of smart grids, since their activities account for a large portion of the total energy demand. Therefore, utility companies, governmental agencies, and various other entities with environmental concerns aim at lowering and shaping energy consumption patterns to achieve peak load reduction, load smoothing, and hence carbon emission curtailment. In this survey paper, we present an overview of approaches for engaging smart grid consumers and for providing them with information, motivation, and recommendations for energy efficiency through mobile apps. Our focus is to bring machine learning approaches closer to smart grid mobile apps so as to optimally manage consumer flexibility and enhance energy savings through detailed consumer profiling and modeling, since an increasing amount of energy consumer data is becoming available. A novel survey and analysis of prior work in the area is conducted in order to identify gaps from this perspective. We consider both recent research project outputs and commercial products and we discuss various aspects of the designs, such as state-of-the-art technologies, extrinsic and intrinsic motivation techniques, gamification, consumer profiling, and the role of machine learning and recommender systems in this context. Furthermore, different mobile apps are presented and compared based on the most important features that affect consumer energy efficiency and sustainability, such as data visualization, gamification, flexibility, consumer profiling methods, feedback mechanisms, recommendations, social media, and machine learning integration. The main goal of this work is to identify how mobile apps incorporate these features to engage energy consumers in energy-efficient behavior, assess the current state-of-the-art in the area, and highlight future research directions.

TI  - Planning the maintenance of green building materials for sustainable development: a building information modelling approach
PY  - 2020
AU  - Ismail, Z.-A.
AB  - Purpose: Most green building (GB) materials, which are used widely in the construction sector in Malaysia, perform poorly in terms of energy efficiency and sustainability. Nevertheless, during maintenance planning of these materials, the focus is often directed towards comfort and design instead. However, as GB material construction projects grow in scale and complexity, interconnections between the activities and processes can be noticed during problematic planning performance management to monitor the GB material components for corrective and preventive maintenance actions. Design/methodology/approach: The concept of GB material maintenance planning for sustainable development and the main features of information and communication technology tools and techniques are based on analysis of literature reviews of GB material scenarios. Findings: The results show how decision-making support in maintenance planning can be unsuccessful and how planning decisions can frame the content of an integrated system to analyse information and reduce risks of GB material failure. Originality/value: The paper concludes that implementing a research framework for developing such a system can help improve the sustainable performance of maintenance planning of GB material economic, social and environmental issues. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - The reduction of energy usage and environmental impact of the built environment and construction industry is crucial for sustainability on a global scale. We are working towards an increased commitment towards resource efficiency in the built environment and to the growth of innovative businesses following circular economy principles. The conceptualization of change is a relevant part of energy and sustainability transitions research, which is aimed at enabling radical shifts compatible with societal functions. In this framework, building performance has to be considered in a whole life cycle perspective because buildings are long-term assets. In a life cycle perspective, both operational and embodied energy and carbon emissions have to be considered for appropriate comparability and decision-making. The application of sustainability assessments of products and practices in the built environment is itself a critical and debatable issue. For this reason, the way energy consumption data are measured, processed, and reported has to be progressively standardized in order to enable transparency and consistency of methods at multiple scales (from single buildings up to building stock) and levels of analysis (from individual components up to systems), ideally complementing ongoing research initiatives that use open science principles in energy research. In this paper, we analyse the topic of linking design and operation phase’s energy performance analysis through regression-based approaches in buildings, highlighting the hierarchical nature of building energy modelling data. The goal of this research is to review the current state of the art of in order to orient future efforts towards integrated data analysis workflows, from design to operation. In this sense, we show how data analysis techniques can be used to evaluate the impact of both technical and human factors. Finally, we indicate how approximated physical interpretation of regression models can help in developing data-driven models that could enhance the possibility of learning from feedback and reconstructing building stock data at multiple levels. © 2020 Manfren, Nastasi and Tronchin.

AB  - Worldwide the construction industry presents a significant demand for new technologies ensuring certainty, cost-effectiveness and time efficiency. Modern construction relies on digital resources, and one of the most prominent novelties is Building Information Modelling (BIM). Construction planning effectiveness is based on clear communication and integration between project planners and other participants, such as engineers, architects, suppliers, and workforce. The possible connection between 3D models and time or scheduling potentially reduces misconception risks and lack of information to avoid re-scheduling and project delivery delays. This study aims to investigate the integration of Revit, Navisworks, Tally and Green Building Studio for identifying the challenges in applying 4D BIM technology using a case study in a developing country (Brazil). The research method used comprised these steps: objectives definition, literature review, development of the 4D analysis and evaluation, case study for validation with comparison to other comparable and contrasting studies, and discussion of the results. This paper demonstrates the feasibility and challenges to adopt BIM technology to thrive better communication for teams and stakeholders through the various construction stages via visual representation. Additionally, despite the obstacles and difficulties to integrate different software, it is beneficial to the decision-makers, not only focus on the constructability perspective but project’s environmental impacts, such as energy efficiency and global warming effect. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AU  - Ustun, T.S.

AB  - As the number of electric vehicles and PhotoVoltaic (PV) panels per household increases, the need for a coordination between these active components becomes more imminent. Home energy management systems (HEMS) have been proposed to increase efficiency, renewable energy capture and reduce costs for the owners. However, renewable energy is intermittent and time dependent. To increase the capture of this source, an integrated control with Electric Vehicle (EVs) is required to store excessive solar energy. Furthermore, coordination with the load profile enables storage for use at a later time or selling the excess energy to the grid. This requires the use of a Home Energy Management System (HEMS) that can coordinate all these components with the grid. Operation of these controllers need to be validated before actual deployment. In this paper, a standardized communication modeling based on IEC 61850 is developed for a HEMS controller. An integrated emulation platform using network simulator and IEC 61850 Intelligent Electronic Devices (IEDs) emulator is set up and the operation of HEMS is demonstrated with proper message exchanges. Such validation is crucial to project's success before on-site deployment. © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - Preventing energy loss in commercial and office buildings can increase economic benefits, and will help protect the environment by reducing the emissions of greenhouse gases. The mentioned parameters are among the main pillars of sustainability and are also the most important items emphasized in EU 2030 sustainability goals. Accordingly, governments and researchers have paid enormous attention to find effective ways to manage and sustain the energy use in such buildings. In this regard, energy analysis tools have been widely used by designers to enhance energy efficiency of buildings. Building Information Modeling (BIM) enables users to evaluate different design alternatives and select the best critical energy strategies and systems in the conceptual design phase of any proposed projects. The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the application of the BIM in assessing the effect of different methods on reducing energy consumption, energy loss, and greenhouse gas emissions in the early stages of the building design process. Indeed, BIM can offer the best option(s) prior to make the decisions about how to construct buildings by analyzing various methods to obtain the required information. Results indicated that in the project under study, the application of inside insulators can reduce the consumption of electricity and gas by 4.76% and 11.06%, respectively, as well as the CO2 emissions by 10.75%. The use of outside insulation was also illustrated to be able to reduce electricity and gas consumption by 7.17% and 30.48%, respectively and CO2 emissions by 29.31%. © 2020, Centre for Research on Settlements and Urbanism, Faculty of Geography, Babes-Bolyai University.

AB  - The main source of building energy consumption in Iran is fossil fuels. The building sector, as a result, is responsible for a high share of CO2 emissions in this country. To address the issue, the government has recently adopted the “green management system” policy in order to alleviate the severe rate of CO2 emissions from the government buildings. As a commitment to the policy, the University of Tehran plans to transform into the first green university of Iran through green retrofitting in the coming years. As the first step to the retrofitting process, this paper measures the potential of energy-saving and CO2 emission reduction in the University of Tehran Science &amp; Technology Park (UTSTP) offices with the use of Building Information Modeling (BIM). For this, Building No. 2 of UTSTP is modeled in the environment of DesignBuilder software to provide a calibrated computational model for energy and carbon audit. A detailed audit is then conducted using the calibrated model to identify the major areas of energy loss in the case study. Based on the audit results, several green strategies are then proposed to improve the weak performance of building in the identified areas. The strategies include triple glazing windows, aerogel envelope, phase change material (PCM) insulation, and Trombe wall. Findings suggest that the thermal loss from the building structure as a result of insufficient levels of insulation in the building components is the main source of energy loss in the building. Simulation results show that green strategies to a large extent have good energy-saving and mitigation potential. Full implementation of the proposed green strategies would reduce the annual heating needs and CO2 emissions of the case study by 51.6% and 5.39% respectively. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - The Internet of Things (IoT) can support a significant number of services including those in smart homes and the automation of industries and public utilities. However, the growth of these deployments has posed a significant challenge especially in terms of how to build such deployments in a highly resilient manner. The IoT devices are prone to unpredicted failures and cyber-attacks, i.e. various types of damage, unreliable wireless connections, limited transmission power, computing ability, and storage space. Thus resilience is essential in IoT networks and in the services they support. In this paper, we introduce a new approach to resilience in IoT service embedding, based on traffic splitting. Our study assesses the power consumption associated with the services embedded and the data delivery time. The results are compared to recent approaches in resilience including redundancy and replication approaches. We constructed an optimization model whose goal is to determine the optimum physical resources to be used to embed the IoT virtual topology, where the latter is derived from a business process (BP). The embedding process makes use of the service-oriented architecture (SOA) paradigm. The physical resources of interest include IoT links and devices. The model made use of mixed integer linear programming (MILP) with an objective function that aimed to minimize both the total power consumption and the traffic latency. The optimization results show that the power consumption is reduced and the data delivery time is reduced in the service embedding approach where the proposed traffic splitting approach is employed resulting in the selection of energy efficient nodes and routes in the IoT network. Our methods resulted in up to 35% power saving compared to current methods and reduced the average traffic latency by up to 37% by selecting energy-efficient nodes and routes in IoT networks and by optimizing traffic flow to minimize latency. © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - For most modern data centres, it is of high value to select practical methods for improving energy efficiency and reducing energy waste. IT-equipment and cooling systems are the two most significant energy consumers in data centres, thus the energy efficiency of any data centre mainly relies on the energy efficiency of its computational and cooling systems. Existing techniques of optimising the energy usage of both these systems have to be compared. However, such experiments cannot be conducted in real plants as they may harm the electronic equipment. This paper proposes a modelling toolbox which enables building models of data centres of any scale and configuration with relative ease. The toolbox is implemented as a set of building blocks which model individual components of a typical data centre, such as processors, local fans, servers, units of cooling systems, it provides methods of adjusting the internal parameters of the building blocks, as well as contains constructors utilising the building blocks for building models of data centre systems of different levels from server to the server room. The data centre model is meant to accurate estimating the energy consumption as well as the evolution of the temperature of all computational nodes and the air temperature inside the data centre. The constructed model capable of substitute for the real data centre at examining the performance of different energy-saving strategies in dynamic mode: the model provides information about data centre operating states at each time point (as model outputs) and takes values of adjustable parameters as the control signals from system implementing energy-saving algorithm (as model inputs). For Module 1 of the SICS ICE data centre located in Luleå, Sweden, the model was constructed from the building blocks. After adjusting the internal parameters of the building blocks, the model demonstrated the behaviour quite close to real data from the SICS ICE data centre. Therefore the model is applicable to use as a substitute for the real data centre. Some examples of using the model for testing energy-saving strategies are presented at the end of the paper. © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - The strength of Building Information Modeling (BIM) in achieving sustainable buildings is well recognized by the global construction industry. However, current understanding of the state-of-the-art green BIM research is still limited. In particular, a focus study on how BIM contribute to green building design through building performance analysis (BPA) is not available. This paper aims to provide systematic and comprehensive insights on current trends and future potentials of green BIM research by analyzing the existing literature with their research features (i.e. research backgrounds, goals, methods and outputs). In total, 80 publications have been collected, analyzed and discussed. The results show that among ten main BPA types, energy & thermal analysis, green building rating analysis, and cost and benefit analysis are the most studied. However, wind & ventilation analysis, acoustic analysis, and water efficiency analysis receive little attention. Moreover, more research focusing on integrated design analysis should be carried out for optimal design outcome. In addition, most of the collected literature research on the capability of data integration and analysis of green BIM tools, while their capability of visualization and documentation has limited examination. Furthermore, most researchers utilized one main software package while utilization of information exchange formats (IEF) is limited. To increase interoperability of green BIM tools, how different BIM authoring tools and IEFs can be utilized for BPA requires further investigation. © 2020 The author(s).

AB  - This work applies the Dynamic Advanced Exergy Analysis (DAEA) to a heating and domestic hot water (DHW) facility supplied by a Stirling engine and a condensing boiler. For the first time, an advanced exergy analysis using dynamic conditions is applied to a building energy system. DAEA provides insights on the components' exergy destruction (ED) by distinguishing the in efficiencies that can be prevented by improving the quality (avoidable ED) and the ones constrained because of technical limitations (unavoidable ED). ED is related to the inherent in efficiencies of the considered element (endogenous ED) and those coming from the interconnections (exogenous ED). That information cannot be obtained by any other approach. A dynamic calculation within the experimental facility has been performed after a component characterization driven by a new grey-box modelling technique, through TRNSYS and MATLAB. Novel solutions and terms of ED are assessed for the rational implementation of the DAEA in building energy installations. The influence of each component and their interconnections are valuated in terms of exergy destruction for further diagnosis and optimization purposes. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - Comfort level in the human body is an index that is always difficult to evaluate in a general and objective manner. Therefore, building owners and managers have been known to adjust environmental physical parameters such as temperature, humidity, and air quality based on people’s subjective sensations to yield satisfactory feelings of comfort. Furthermore, electricity consumption could be reduced by minimizing unnecessary use of heating and cooling equipment based on precise knowledge of comfort levels in interior spaces. To achieve the aforementioned objectives, this study undertook the following four tasks: first, providing visualization and smart suggestion functions to assist building managers and users in analyzing and developing plans based on the demands of space usage and electrical equipment; second, using Internet of Things technology to minimize the difference between real situations and those simulated in building information modeling (BIM); third, accurately evaluating interior environment comfort levels and improving equipment operating efficiency based on quantized comfort levels; and fourth, establishing a persuasive workflow for building energy saving systems. Through developing this system, COZyBIM will help to enhance the satisfactions of comfort level in interior space and operate energy consuming equipment efficiently, to reach the target of energy saving. © 2019 by the authors.

TI  - Information requirements for multi-level-of-development BIM using sensitivity analysis for energy performance

AB  - The concept of multi-Level-of-Development (multi-LOD) modelling represents a flexible approach of information management and compilation in building information modelling (BIM) on a set of consistent levels. From an energy perspective during early architectural design, the refinement of design parameters by addition of information allows a more precise prediction of building performance. The need for energy-efficient buildings requires a designer to focus on the parameters in order of their ability to reduce uncertainty in energy performance to prioritise energy relevant decisions. However, there is no method for assigning and prioritising information for a particular level of multi-LOD. In this study, we performed a sensitivity analysis of energy models to estimate the uncertainty caused by the design parameters in energy prediction. This study allows to rank the design parameters in order of their influence on the energy prediction and determine the information required at each level of multi-LOD approach. We have studied the parametric energy model of different building shapes representing architectural design variation at the early design stage. A variance-based sensitivity analysis method is used to calculate the uncertainty contribution of each design parameter. The three levels in the uncertainty contribution by the group of parameters are identified which form the basis of information required at each level of multi-LOD BIM approach. The first level includes geometrical parameters, the second level includes technical specification and operational design parameters, and the third level includes window construction and system efficiency parameters. These findings will be specifically useful in the development of a multi-LOD approach to prioritise performance relevant decisions at early design phases. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The transition of the conventional energy supply scheme, typically characterized by integration of more small-scale renewable sources and reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, is an inevitable trend. At the same time, efficient operation of the existing distribution system, which hosts these decentralized generators, is equally important toward achieving a sustainable energy system. In order to keep track of the upcoming changes regarding system efficiency, an accurate determination of grid losses in the distribution system is the fundamental step. However, to evaluate the energy losses of power distribution grids at large scales is a difficult task. Currently, distribution system operators only have limited options for determining grid losses, especially in the low voltage sector. The growing installation rate and the fluctuating nature of distributed generations pose further difficulties and uncertainties for the loss evaluations. For this reason, a comprehensive and accurate evaluation on grid losses, which takes the grid information, the available metering data and the installed distributed generations into account, is highly relevant. In this work, a novel evaluation framework for energy losses for low voltage distribution grids is presented. Our evaluation framework consists of three building blocks: a fully automatic and parallelized generation of grid models, the determination of grid losses based on annual power flow simulations as well as a data-driven reference grid modeling method. We demonstrate and validate this framework based on a data-set of 5000 real distribution grids (including about 31,000 low voltage feeders), located in the service area of one of the largest German distribution system operators. The key contribution of the proposed framework is the automatic approach for grid modeling and feature evaluation at large scales and the implementation of the advanced, comprehensive reference grid modeling method for evaluating relevant grid features and estimating grid losses. This novel reference grid modeling approach and the complete framework are further validated by comparison with both exhaustive simulation results of grid losses and three state-of-the-art regression schemes. Among the case studies, this proposed evaluation framework shows a very good performance in the evaluation of grid losses. Moreover, this evaluation framework provides useful insights concerning the allocation of energy losses as well as the impact of distributed generations on grid losses. Accordingly, this novel evaluation framework gives distribution system operators a powerful tool considering the evaluation and improvement of system efficiency. © 2019

AB  - With the growing energy and economic crises, the need for optimization of energy consumption in the design and construction of buildings has recently become even more significant. This study aimed to determine the best combinations of building-envelope materials with the consideration of influential and uncontrollable factors for energy-efficient design in Malaysia. Residential buildings in Malaysia consume a significant amount of electrical energy for air-conditioning purposes. A typical one-storey terrace house was selected as a case study, and building information modeling (BIM) applications were used to simulate its energy performance. The selected case study was modeled using the Autodesk Revit Software and exported to the EnergyPlus software for energy analysis. In order to optimize the number of examinations in the simulation software, the effect of noise factors was assessed using the Taguchi method. The current energy-consumption patterns were identified and converted into the optimized options in component types. The results of this novel approach provide appropriate information about the performance of the modified energy-efficient material in building components with consideration of noise factors to achieve more reliable outcomes. It was concluded that the appropriate selection of ceiling, window, wall, roof, and floor components could greatly increase energy efficiency in descending order. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Distributed photovoltaic power generation system is the fastest growing distributed power generation system in recent years. The advantages of flexible power generation, high energy efficiency and low environmental pollution make it become an important supplement to traditional power grids. The distributed photovoltaic power plants are mainly installed on various building roofs that need to be measured at the first place. The traditional survey method required manual climbing to measure roofs' structure and size, roof orientation, tilt angle, roof material, roof height and other parameters which was neither safe nor precise. Oblique photography technology is a new aerial survey technology developed in recent years. By carrying multiple sensors on the same flight platform, it can simultaneously capture images from different angles and simultaneously record flight height, speed, coordinates, etc, which can be used to quickly generate texture-rich real-life 3D models. Most of the Oblique photography systems were installed on air planes or fixed-wing drones which had high price and weight. In this research we developed a low-cost portable five-phase oblique camera ZTRS-M5B whose shell was made of lightweight aluminum alloy and designed with quick snaps for loading on all types of drone platforms. The oblique camera's size was 243 mm×243 mm×145 mm and weight was 1.8 kg. The camera automatically controlled the shooting of five Sony QX100s via the STM32F4 high-performance microcontroller and optocoupler and simultaneously recorded position and inertial navigation information using the embedded GNSS/INS system. The unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) mapping system equipped with this oblique camera was used to measure a rural residential area and a factory area. The flight time in the residential area was 14 minutes in which the system took 1 052 images and the flight time in the factory area was 23 minutes in which the system took 1 755 images. All flight parameters were pre-set in DJI GS PRO ground control station which also controlled the UAV mapping system to complete the flight missions automatically. The captured images were pre-processed and imported into the Smart3D software for 3D reconstruction. By comparing with the ground measured values, the 3D reconstruction model's accuracy would be verified. The results showed that the model tilt angle of the photovoltaic power plant solar panel was highly correlated with the actual tilt angle, the average absolute error of the horizontal dimensional size of the building in the model of was 0.11 m and the average relative error was 0.37%, the average absolute error of the vertical dimensional size of the building in the model of was 0.12 m and the average relative error was 1.04%. This system could efficiently and accurately obtain the housing information needed for the construction of distributed photovoltaic power plants in the early stage, ensure the life safety of surveying staff and greatly reduce the cost of oblique photography survey. We also compared ZTRS-M5B's parameters with the traditional aerial oblique camera SWDC-5 and another small UAV oblique camera DM5-4200. It showed ZTRS-M5B had more advantage in the portability and dominated in the price although its image resolution was relative lower. This camera could take place other oblique camera in the market for the small and medium area surveying. © 2019, Editorial Department of the Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

TI  - Integrating building information modeling (BIM) and sensor technology for facility management

AB  - Today high-performance buildings are equipped with sophisticated monitoring systems and sensors for collecting large amounts of data related to the buildings' indoor environmental quality and energy consumption. To visualize, interpret, and utilize the collected data, facility managers and decision-makers typically use text or spreadsheets, which make it difficult to understand and track the real-time building's performance. Building information modeling (BIM) is a process of developing a virtual equivalent of the actual building that supports data exchange, management and communication during the whole building's life cycle. However, the BIM model cannot show real-time information related to the performance of the building in the operational stage. This paper presents three approaches for integration of the building sensor technology and the BIM process to enable visualization and analysis of real-time and historical readings: (i) Sensor-Revit integration; (ii) Sensor-Revit-Navisworks integration; and (iii) Sensor-Revit-Navisworks-API integration. The comparison between the potential value-adding functions of each approach and the associated limitations is discussed. Furthermore, this is the first work to utilize widely-known and popular Autodesk Navisworks software for development of a user-friendly add-in program to enable real-time and historic data characterization and analysis. The overarching aim of this paper is to improve the efficiency of facility management (FM) and utilize BIM data accessible during building's lifecycle. The university engineering building equipped with a monitoring system for tracking and collecting various building-related parameters is used for demonstration of the developed software technologies. This study demonstrates how BIM-sensor integration can lead to more responsive building management and operation by making sensor data tangible and accessible for property managers, owners, and occupants. © 2019 The author(s).

AB  - The building envelope plays a significant role in the energy performance of buildings and windows are a key element in transmitting heating and cooling between the indoor and outdoor environment, and hence an adequate window system is one of the most important retrofit strategies of existing buildings for energy conservation. Therefore, this study presents a method with a theoretical case study to examine the improvement of energy efficiency in a typical high-rise residential building through window retrofitting. A building energy design model in Designbuilder along with a building information modeling (BIM) model in Revit are developed, with 20 common potential glazing alternatives being analyzed to predict the potential energy savings in the same case building with identical orientation located in a variety of climate zones in China. Based on different parameters and considerations, the results demonstrated that the currently relatively expensive low-e window glazing has the best energy performance in all climate zones, but is sufficiently close to conventionally glazed windows in its energy efficiency to discourage its adoption at present, and that, instead, a single dark conventional glazed window is preferred in a hot summer/warm winter climate, double dark traditional glazing in a hot summer/cold winter climate, and a double clear conventional window in a cold climate. Based on the simulated results, an indicative suggestion was provided to select an adequate window system for residential building retrofitting in the studied climates or similar climatic regions. © 2019 by the authors.

TI  - Investigation on roof segmentation for 3D building reconstruction from aerial LIDAR point clouds
PY  - 2019
AU  - Albano, R.
AB  - Three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction techniques are increasingly used to obtain 3D representations of buildings due to the broad range of applications for 3D city models related to sustainability, efficiency and resilience (i.e., energy demand estimation, estimation of the propagation of noise in an urban environment, routing and accessibility, flood or seismic damage assessment). With advancements in airborne laser scanning (ALS), 3D modeling of urban topography has increased its potential to automatize extraction of the characteristics of individual buildings. In 3D building modeling from light detection and ranging (LIDAR) point clouds, one major challenging issue is how to efficiently and accurately segment building regions and extract rooftop features. This study aims to present an investigation and critical comparison of two different fully automatic roof segmentation approaches for 3D building reconstruction. In particular, the paper presents and compares a cluster-based roof segmentation approach that uses (a) a fuzzy c-means clustering method refined through a density clustering and connectivity analysis, and (b) a region growing segmentation approach combined with random sample consensus (RANSAC) method. In addition, a robust 2.5D dual contouring method is utilized to deliver watertight 3D building modeling from the results of each proposed segmentation approach. The benchmark LIDAR point clouds and related reference data (generated by stereo plotting) of 58 buildings over downtown Toronto (Canada), made available to the scientific community by the International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing (ISPRS), have been used to evaluate the quality of the two proposed segmentation approaches by analysing the geometrical accuracy of the roof polygons. Moreover, the results of both approaches have been evaluated under different operating conditions against the real measurements (based on archive documentation and celerimetric surveys realized by a total station system) of a complex building located in the historical center of Matera (UNESCO world heritage site in southern Italy) that has been manually reconstructed in 3D via traditional Building Information Modeling (BIM) technique. The results demonstrate that both methods reach good performance metrics in terms of geometry accuracy. However, approach (b), based on region growing segmentation, exhibited slightly better performance but required greater computational time than the clustering-based approach. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - Mechanical, Electrical and Plumbing (MEP) models are generally characterized by information redundancy and a high density of irregularly shaped components. Consequently, they require large storage spaces and are not conducive for interchange purposes. Geometric optimization of MEP models can play a significant role in facilitating model exchange and handover by increasing storage, transmission and display efficiency. To date, the body of knowledge on such geometric optimization, unfortunately, is still very narrow. This paper presents and tests a solution for the optimization of storage, transmission, and display of MEP models. Storage optimization was achieved through a mapping-based model description method and a novel Quadric-Error-Metric (QEM) mesh simplification algorithm, reducing required storage while maintaining the contour of components. For transmission optimization, a normal vector compression algorithm and a fixed-dictionary specific compression algorithm were proposed to achieve efficient compression of data thus, fulfilling the need for cross-platform interchange. Display optimization was obtained through a normal vector regeneration algorithm for clustering triangle meshes to improve 3D display effects. The evaluation of the solution, performed for each individual component separately as well as for an entire solution, proved successful. Volume of storage data was reduced by 40% to 50% through mesh simplification. Data transmission volume was reduced by more than 80% for components with complicated geometry without affecting the topology of the components. Finally, the display process was capable of decreasing the number of triangles and delivering very good quality of displayed models. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Cost-effectiveness of deep renovation has been assessed thoroughly on a building level. Such studies provide limited guidance when prioritizing renovation measures for a building portfolio. On a stock level, building-stock modelling is commonly used to assess impact of renovation on a national and city level, targeting stakeholders operating at a planning or policy level. However, due to methodological choices and data availability, assessment of property owner portfolios is lacking. The aim of this paper is to calculate and spatially differentiate cost-effectiveness of deep renovation using equivalent annual cost and increase in assessed building value for a portfolio owner as a first step in prioritizing deep renovation within a building portfolio. A bottom-up engineering-based model is applied utilizing building-specific information for a municipal housing company portfolio in the City of Gothenburg, Sweden, consisting of 1803 multi-family buildings. Energy demand for space heating and hot-water is calibrated using measured energy use from energy performance certificates. Deep renovation is assessed by applying a package of measures across all buildings. Results show average energy use reduction across the portfolio of 51% to an average cost of 597 EUR/m2 living area. While average energy cost savings account for 21% of equivalent annual cost, there are seven buildings where more than half the annual equivalent cost of renovation is covered by energy cost savings. Similarly, the distribution of change in assessed building value is large for individual buildings, ranging from 0–23%. Aggregating results to larger areas tend to average out results while differences between individual buildings within areas persists. As such, the cost-effectiveness of deep renovation should be assessed on a building-by-building basis rather than for an area or neighbourhood. The results are intended as a first step in prioritizing deep renovation within a building portfolio and further detailed assessment is needed. © 2019 The Authors

AB  - Globally the building sector accounts for a significant portion of the overall energy demand and greenhouse gas emissions of any country. The most common approach for the collection of modeling and benchmarking data that can be used for predictions of energy performance at a national or urban scale is through classification of the building stock into representative archetypes. Developing such building archetypes is a complex task due to the difficulties associated with gathering detailed geometric and non-geometric data at an urban scale. Although existing databases and projects provide a valuable overview of a building stock, the information about buildings’ physical descriptions are not regularly updated. Moreover, these databases cover only the national top-level archetypes and lack crucial information related to city or district scale building stocks. The use of national scale archetypes requires many assumptions that may not hold true for energy modeling at urban or district scale. This paper proposes a multi-scale (national, city, county and district) archetype development methodology using different data-driven approaches. The methodology consists of following five steps: 1) data collection, 2) segmentation, 3) characterization, 4) quantification, and 5) modeling results. We developed a test case based on the available building stock data of Ireland. The test case used previously developed archetype geometries coupled with the parameters determined by the characterization process to calculate annual energy use (kWh) of buildings at a multiple-scales. The resulting archetypes at national, city, county and district scale are analyzed and compared against one another. The results indicate that significant differences occur in terms of energy modeling results when national scale archetypes are used to simulate the energy performance of buildings at the local scale. These multi-scale building archetypes will aid local authorities and city planners when analyzing energy efficiency and consequently, help to improve sustainable energy policy decisions. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Current processes that create Building Energy Performance Simulation (BEPS) models are time consuming and costly, primarily due to the extensive manual inputs required for model population. In particular, generation of geometric inputs for existing building models requires significant manual intervention due to the absence, or outdated nature of available data or digital measurements. Additionally, solutions based on Building Information Modelling (BIM) also require high quality and precise geometrically-based models, which are not typically available for existing buildings. As such, this work introduces a semi-automated BEPS input solution for existing building exteriors that can be integrated with other related technologies (such as BIM or CityGML) and deployed across an entire building stock. Within the overarching approach, a novel sub-process automatically transforms a point cloud obtained from a terrestrial laser scanner into a representation of a building's exterior façade geometry as input data for a BEPS engine. Semantic enrichment is performed manually. This novel solution extends two existing approaches: (1) an angle criterion in boundary detection and (2) a voxelisation representation to improve performance. The use of laser scanning data reduces temporal costs and improves input accuracy for BEPS model generation of existing buildings. The approach is tested herein on two example cases. Vertical and horizontal accuracies of 1% and 7% were generated, respectively, when compared against independently produced, measured drawings. The approach showed variation in accuracy of model generation, particularly for upper floors of the test case buildings. However, the energy impacts resulting from these variations represented less than 1% of the energy consumption for both cases. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Existing building stock is responsible for a significant share of energy consumption in cities, consequent emissions, and effects on climate change. Energy refurbishment of buildings can have an essential contribution to sustainable strategies of cities in Europe. District-Scale Refurbishment (D-SR) has many benefits compared to single building refurbishment, but some barriers have delayed the realisation of district-scale projects. This article aims to explain the importance of district-scale approaches for energy-efficient refurbishment and presents the findings related to the need for a new-type of role needed to accelerate district-level energy-efficient refurbishment projects, defined as an “activator”. Threefold methodology was applied to conduct this study including (1) a literature review to analyse issues that enable or hinder district-scale energy refurbishment of existing buildings, (2) twenty-five semi-structured interviews were carried out of pioneering representatives of architectural engineering and construction (AEC) in Finland and the questionnaire was designed to encompass Osterwalder's business canvas approach. Thematic findings were identified based on the qualitative results of the interviews. The results of this study demonstrate that while district-scale refurbishment is seen beneficial in many aspects, it requires new roles, and an activator is needed to initiate and possibly lead the process. At the same time, the role of the municipality emerged as extremely important as an enabler by supporting flexible town-planning, open information, strong support for citizens' participation processes and by providing incentives for starting the process. The optimum profile of an activator is very demanding, requiring skills in process understanding, networking, and collaboration, in addition to expertise in energy solutions and technologies. This role could be taken by, e.g. contractors, project managers or engineering companies. The major challenge remains concerning who would pay for the role of an ‘activator’ during the initial stages of D-SR. This could be solved e.g. through a national incentive or the activator could be hired by the municipality. The value proposition should be for the end-users and could be based on (a) saving or increasing the value of a residential flat, (b) improving the living environment and increasing the attractiveness of the district, (c) improving well-being, or (d) easiness of refurbishment process. © 2019

AB  - The building sector of the U.S. currently consumes over 40% of the U.S. primary energy supply. Estimates suggest that between 5% and 30% of any building's annual energy consumption is unknowingly wasted due to pathologically malfunctioning lighting and comfort conditioning systems. This paper presents analytical methods embodied within useful software tools to quickly identify and evaluate selected faults in air handling units (AHU) that cause large building energy inefficiencies. Algorithm for faults like stuck dampers and leaking dampers have been developed and tested in this particular case study. These damper fault detection algorithms can be applied to outdoor air and return air dampers both. The technical contributions of this work include expert rules that adapt to the Heating, Ventilation and Air-Conditioning (HVAC) equipment scale and operation and methods for sorting fault signals according to user-defined interests such as annual cost of energy inefficiencies. The combination of expert-rule based fault detection combined with first principles thermodynamic modeling is a unique contribution of this work that leads to quicker fault detection with minimal non-intrusive measurements. These contributions are particularly unique in their treatment of models and the careful consideration of user-interests in fault evaluation. As a first step to developing this general framework for fault detection, first-order faults such as stuck dampers and imbalanced airflows within several large air-handling units were targeted. The algorithms focused on detecting faults with minimal data and non-intrusive measurements. An example is presented of the potential energy savings in a large academic building that has been monitored. Real data from an academic building in Boston was collected from the building energy management system (BEMS) for the purpose of this study. Savings of around $3400/month or 18% of the monthly cost when a stuck damper fault occurred over an entire month in an air handler. Another fault that was investigated was that of leaking dampers which lead to savings of approximately $500/month or around 2.5% of the monthly energy expense. The savings would accrue if the fault were corrected; otherwise the occurrence of the fault causes a waste of money and energy predicted. The algorithms developed can be applied to large commercial office buildings, academic buildings, hospitals and other modern buildings in various climates as long as they have data collecting capabilities. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Buildings are one of the largest energy consumers in the world, and have great energy saving potential. Thermal systems and lighting systems take most of the energy in a building. Comparing with the optimization solutions developed for a thermal system, the research of improving the lighting system is insufficient. This study aims to improve the lighting environment and reduce the energy by optimizing the building design, which has the largest potential for cutting energy economically compared with the other stages in the life cycle of a building. Although many approaches have been developed for building design optimization, there is still one big problem obstructing their successful practices, in that the designers who take the responsibility of making building designs are not experts in building physics, thus they are not capable of calculating the most appropriate parameters and operating the professional software to optimize their designs. Therefore, this study proposes a user-friendly method for designers to improve building designs. Firstly, Building Information Modeling (BIM) and particle swarm optimization algorithm are applied to build an intelligent optimal design search system. The optimized design from this system can largely use daylighting for internal illumination and save energy. Secondly, different types of lighting control systems are compared and the one which can save maximal energy is added to the selected optimal design. A case study demonstrates that optimized designs generated by the proposed design method can save large amounts of life cycle energy and costs, and is effective and efficient. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - Energy consumption in buildings is a very important issue, where the operational demand is considered to be one of the highest amongst all other sectors of an economy. Moving towards energy efficient buildings is a key factor to achieve sustainability. A novel framework for integrating mathematical optimization, Building Information Modeling, and Life Cycle Assessment to enhance the operating energy efficiency of the resulting building designs adopted, along with reducing the difficulties associated with the construction of the building, in terms of cost of construction, is developed. The framework accommodates various parameters, via integrating mathematical optimization programming, Building Information Modeling, and Life Cycle Assessment to improve the building performance, identify alternative sustainable designs, and empower the decision-making process and sustainability in the construction sector. Through the developed optimization model, the examination of various alternatives for building components that make up the envelope of a residential building is undertaken. Insights gained from the results show that all components of building envelopes influence the energy consumption in buildings, particularly, exterior walls and windows. Impacts in terms of annual energy use intensity can be reduced by about 45%, life cycle energy use and cost can be enhanced by more than 50%, and environmental impacts such as acidification and global warming potential can be reduced by more than 30%, due to use of the proposed framework. This work indicates that sustainable building decisions can be achieved by optimizing the material selection and assessment of environmental impact via Building Information Modeling and life cycle assessment. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This study focused on the energy consumption and environmental comfort of the traditional Xindian Central Public Retail Market. Established for more than 30 years, the market has been a crucial role in the daily life of local residents. Thus, the energy consumption and comfort level of the market are subjects of great concern. By using green building information modeling (BIM) simulation, which is an innovative assessment process that combines green buildings and BIM for the architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) industries to achieve sustainability, this study explored the current situation of energy efficiency and comfort level of the market. A green BIM model of the market and surrounding area was constructed in Autodesk Revit. Subsequently, nine items pertaining to energy consumption and environmental comfort were selected from the green BIM model to conduct simulation by using the software package Integrated Environmental Solutions Virtual Environment (IES VE). Based on the IES VE simulation results, heat radiation was identified as one of the main causes of energy consumption in the market. Moreover, the results indicated problems of ventilation and insufficient sunlight inside the market. These analytical outcomes and optimization suggestions can be provided as references for retrofitting to obtain sustainable architectures in future. © 2019 by the authors.

AU  - Chen, S.Y.
AB  - In the face of extreme climate, Net Zero Energy Buildings (NZEBs) represent a very high standard of building energy conservation. The design of NZEBs requires continuous design improvement and analysis in a decision-making process that seeks to meet energy conservation goals. This paper recommends the use of green Building Information Modelling (BIM) to support the design of zero-energy buildings. The design of NZEBs requires two sets of tasks: First, it requires determination of whether the building will offer high-energy efficiency, and, second, it lacks the installation of sufficient renewable energy equipment to meet the building’s load needs. After drawing on the spirit of the United States’ Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design and considering the current situation in Taiwan, this paper recommends the use of electricity Energy Usage Intensity as a measurement unit providing a holistic indicator of energy usage and takes optimized energy performance as a performance target for various solutions. This study demonstrated procedural steps in the application of green BIM and analyzed restrictions on the implementation of green BIM to the analysis of NZEB design. © 2019 The Author(s).

AB  - Residential buildings are the significant energy consumer of the India which is about 24% of the total energy consumption. Energy efficient buildings are the ideal solution to reduce energy consumption in the building sector. The energy efficient buildings can be achieved by incorporating passive features or renewable energy systems or both. The current work aims to perform a retrofitting analysis of an existing building into an energy efficient building. For performing the energy analysis REVIT 2017 tool is used. Using the REVIT 2017 tool building model is developed, building information are loaded and energy analyses are performed. The building is analyzed as two cases. The first case is to estimate energy performance of the existing building. The second case is to incorporate passive features and renewable energy system to the building and evaluate the energy performance. Existing building Energy Usage Intensity (EUI) was 193 kWh/m2 /year. When passive features (Insulation, additional window glazing and efficient air conditioning systems) alone incorporated to the building the building EUI is reduced to 138 kWh/m2 /year. Along with Passive features Photovoltaic modules with different efficiencies 16%, 18% and 20% are considered for renewable energy generation. The energy generation for the different PV modules for three different roof area (40%, 60% and 70% of total roof area) is evaluated. The energy usage intensity varies from 11.4 from-150 kWh/m2 /year for the combination of different efficiency of PV module and the different % of roof area covered. The negative sign indicates the energy generation after the required energy usage. The payback period for only incorporating passive features is 6.3 years and while incorporating PV system with passive features is 9 years. © BEIESP.

AB  - Due to increasing dependence of our modern life on automated household equipment, higher energy demand has posed significant burden on electricity consumption in major housing models. A large number of old houses and apartment buildings in major cities are energy-deficient, leading to significant overloading of the existing nuclear power plants. Secondary consequences such as increase in electricity unit rate are also financially affecting the owners of the buildings. In this paper, it is proposed to develop newer strategies to identify critical variables contributing to energy efficiency and design more energy-efficient housing architectures. The need to reduce global warming and achieve near-zero-energy building leads to the development of new research idea where multicomponent energy assessment of the buildings can be performed by changing various parameters such as orientation and surroundings of a house, materials and other internal and external configurations. It is proposed to use Building Information Modeling (BIM) to virtually model a house and evaluate its energy performance. Changes of internal and external configurations of a structure can impact annualized maintenance budget of residential houses and other public infrastructure such as walk-in clinics, shopping complexes or office buildings. Various case studies are conducted which enable the building owners to better understand the practical aspects of designing green buildings, thereby leading to significant cost-savings and strengthen the quality of life in major cities. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This work presents the benefits of using a model predictive control (MPC) approach for controlling a high efficiency absorption chiller-based solar cooling system with thermal energy storage, incorporating perfect solar resource and load forecasting information. A dynamic physics-based model of the solar air-conditioning system has been built for studying the system behavior. A genetic algorithm based predictive controller is utilized to minimize backup energy consumption while satisfying the cooling demand. The simulations have been carried out using the open-source programming language Python. Detailed investigation of the role of the predictive controller and its decision strategy have been carried out using ten and fifty days simulations. Effect of storage tank heat losses has been investigated. For the simulated example case pertaining to a building, results show the model predictive controller usage delivers about 10% reduction in auxiliary energy use in the system. This is achieved through reduction in tank heat losses, better utilization of heat stored in the tank. It is seen that the MPC based controller enables new system operational capabilities by running the solar collector pump in variable flow mode and allowing the simultaneous heat delivery from storage and backup devices. Opportunities to improve the MPC benefits have been identified. The benefits of the MPC are seen to be sensitive to the system parameters and specific constraints. In summary, this paper provides valuable insights into solar cooling system design and control. © 2019

AB  - Measures to improve the building energy efficiency of deteriorated multi-family housing complexes (MFHCs) require trade-offs between economic and environmental feasibility, and therefore these aspects should be considered simultaneously. Towards this end, this study aimed to develop a multi-objective optimization model for determining the optimal CO2 emission reduction (CER) strategies for MFHCs that can be used not only by experts but also by non-experts. This study used integrated multi-objective optimization with a genetic algorithm as an optimization methodology. The developed model, which considers the five optimization objectives (i.e., initial investment cost, net present value, savings-to-investment cost, CER, and marginal abatement cost) at the same time, can review a total of 31,200 scenarios combined with four energy saving measures (i.e., insulation, window, lighting, and shading systems). To verify the feasibility of the developed model, this study conducted a case study targeting ‘D’ MFHC in South Korea. First, the accuracy of the calibration of the energy simulation model for ‘D’ MFHC (coefficient of variation of the root mean square error: 12.84%; mean bias error: 0.39%) satisfied the criteria of ASHRAE Guideline 14; second, I8 (expanded polystyrene board - type 1 (No. 4))-L3 (LED lighting installed in louvered ceiling) and I8 (expanded polystyrene board - type 1 (No. 4)) - L4 (ceiling-mounted light) were determined to be the optimal CER strategy (integrated multi-objective optimization score: 0.2252). The developed model can help building owners make the optimal decision on green modeling by entering simple information (e.g., region, total floor area, etc.). © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The buildings’ sector accounts for a large share of energy consumption on a global scale. This scenario generates the need to design and construct more efficient buildings and also requires new policies and incentives. The greatest opportunities for integrating energy efficiency strategies in construction occur at the design stage, in which decisions that will have significant impacts on the building’s life cycle are taken. Therefore, the use of Building Information Modeling (BIM) is considered, as well as parametric design: New design technologies that allow the analysis of multiple scenarios to support the decisions during the design stage. The purpose of this study is to provide, through a literature analysis, an overview about practical applications of BIM and parametric design for buildings’ energy efficiency in a recent research scenario. Studies were categorized according to their main approach and the main software used. In addition, benefits provided by the use of the technologies adopted were highlighted. © 2019, Universidade do Vale do Rio dos Sinos. All rights reserved.

AB  - Information-Centric Networking (ICN) is a paradigm shift from host-to-host Internet Protocol (IP)-based communication to content-based communication. In ICN, the content-retrieval process employs names that are given through different naming schemes such as hierarchical, flat, attribute, and hybrid. Among different ICN architectures, Named-Data Networking (NDN) has gained much interest in the research community and is actively being explored for the Internet of Things (IoT) and sensor networks, and follows a hierarchical naming format. NDN protocol follows a pull-based communication model where the content consumer gets content irrespective of the location of the content provider. The content provider in NDN and sensor networks can be considered to be a distributed database that monitors or controls the environment and caches the sensed data or controls information into their memory. The proposed Name-INtegrated Query (NINQ) framework for NDN-based IoT provides a flexible, expressive, and secure query mechanism that supports content retrieval as well as control and configuration command exchange among various nodes in a smart building. Different use cases are presented in this paper that expand on the behavior of proposed query framework in different scenarios. Simulation results of data collection and exchange of control commands show that proposed query framework significantly improves Interest Satisfaction Rate (ISR), Command Satisfaction Rate (CSR), energy efficiency, and average delay. Moreover, it is evident from the simulation results that proposed query framework significantly reduces the number of transmissions in the network in both data collection and exchange of control command scenarios, which improves the network performance. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - The study aims to design and develop an integrated system to model and optimize the direct metal deposition process. Direct metal deposition is an emerging metal additive manufacturing technology, in which powder particles are melted using a high-energy laser source to consolidate a solid layer. With the aim to work with a variety of materials, process economy is an important consideration. Keeping this in mind, the present work shows application of statistical methods and evolutionary algorithms in laser-based manufacturing. A regression model using response surface method has been developed considering laser power, scan speed and powder flow rate as the process parameters, while capture efficiency and clad layer height are considered as the clad characteristics response. The developed regression model provides useful information to control responses and ensure building a desired clad layer height as per prototyping requirements. A robust correlation between the experimentally obtained values and model-predicted values for responses is achieved, and the error percentage is 5% and 10% for capture efficiency and clad layer height, respectively. Genetic algorithm-based approach for optimization yields improvement of 30.93% and 71.02% for capture efficiency and clad layer height, respectively. © 2019, The Brazilian Society of Mechanical Sciences and Engineering.

AB  - Growing climate change challenges and increasingly strict sustainability standards have led to a significant growth in the need for building refurbishment projects which are essentially focused on retrofitting in order to make them low carbon, energy efficient and environmentally friendly. The Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP) suggested that Building Information Modelling (BIM) should be used to achieve sustainability requirements during refurbishment projects as a correspondence to the National Audit Office (NAO) sustainability report. BIM is now widely advocated as the preferred tool for the management and co-ordination of design and construction data using object- oriented principles. The successful integration of environmental assessment into BIM for the whole of the construction lifecycle has not yet been achieved. The potential for using BIM in refurbishment projects specifically for achieving and managing sustainability requirements has not been yet critically reviewed or put into practice. This paper focuses on the use of BIM sustainability design tools in refurbishment projects, to achieve energy efficient buildings and achieve sustainability criteria for refurbishing non-domestic buildings. A critical lens is cast on the current literature in the domains of sustainable designs and the associated implications of the sustainability decision-support tools in BIM. The research also reviews the practicality of the existing sustainability decision-support tools that are currently used to assist with achieving environmental scheme certifications such as BREEAM and LEED for refurbishment projects. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - An algorithm to facet curved walls in IFC BIM for building energy analysis
PY  - 2019
AU  - Ying, H.
AU  - Lee, S.
AB  - The automatic transformation of a Building Information Model (BIM) in Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) to a building energy model (BEM) demonstrates significant benefits on the improvement of efficiency and accuracy in a building energy modeling process. However, so far, building objects with curved surfaces in IFC models are not supported by existing transformation approaches as they only handle polyhedral geometries. This study presents an algorithm to automatically facet curved walls and convert their geometries into polyhedrons, so that they can be further processed by existing transformation approaches. In the process of faceting curved walls, geometric connections between each target wall and adjacent walls are detected and handled to maintain the connections in the results. Furthermore, the algorithm updates the geometries of relevant building objects, including straight walls connected to curved walls, openings (i.e., windows and doors) on curved walls and spaces enclosed by curved walls, based on the faceted geometries. This removes curved surfaces of these objects on the one hand, and maintains their geometric relationships on the other. Moreover, slabs with the curved surfaces are also faceted. This algorithm takes an IFC BIM that pertains to the model view definition Concept Design BIM 2010 as an input. It generates a new IFC BIM, in which all curved walls and relevant building objects are represented as polyhedral geometries with correct geometric relationships. A prototype application that implements the algorithm was developed to evaluate the performance of the algorithm with a simple building model and a complex real-world building model. In the results, all the curved walls were faceted, and all relevant straight walls, openings, spaces and slabs were correctly updated, which indicated that the algorithm worked as intended. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Reduced complexity climate models are useful tools for quantifying decision-relevant uncertainties, given their flexibility, computational efficiency, and suitability for large-ensemble frameworks necessary for statistical estimation using resampling techniques (e.g., Markov chain Monte Carlo). Here we document a new version of the simple, open-source, global climate model Hector, coupled with a 1-D diffusive heat and energy balance model (Diffusion Ocean Energy balance CLIMate model) and a sea level change module (Building blocks for Relevant Ice and Climate Knowledge) that also represents contributions from thermal expansion, glaciers and ice caps, and polar ice sheets. We apply a Bayesian calibration approach to quantify model uncertainties surrounding 39 model parameters with prescribed radiative forcing, using observational information from global surface temperature, thermal expansion, and other contributors to sea level change. We find the addition of thermal expansion as an observational constraint sharpens inference for the upper tail of posterior equilibrium climate sensitivity estimates (the 97.5 percentile is tightened from 7.1 to 6.6 K), while other contributors to sea level change play a lesser role. The thermal expansion constraint also has implications for probabilistic projections of global surface temperature (the 97.5 percentile for RCP8.5 2100 temperature decreases 0.3 K). Due to the model's parameterization of thermal expansion as an uncertain function of global ocean heat, we note a trade-off between two ways of incorporating thermal expansion information: Ocean heat data provide a somewhat sharper equilibrium climate sensitivity estimate while thermal expansion data allow for constrained sea level projections. ©2019.

AB  - Estimates of population air pollution exposure typically rely on the outdoor component only, and rarely account for populations spending the majority of their time indoors. Housing is an important modifier of air pollution exposure due to outdoor pollution infiltrating indoors, and the removal of indoor-sourced pollution through active or passive ventilation. Here, we describe the application of an indoor air pollution modelling tool to a spatially distributed housing stock model for England and Wales, developed from Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) data and containing information for approximately 11.5 million dwellings. First, we estimate indoor/outdoor (I/O) ratios and total indoor concentrations of outdoor air pollution for PM 2.5 and NO 2 for all EPC dwellings in London. The potential to estimate concentration from both indoor and outdoor sources is then demonstrated by modelling indoor background CO levels for England and Wales pre- and post-energy efficient adaptation, including heating, cooking, and smoking as internal sources. In London, we predict a median I/O ratio of 0.60 (99% CIs; 0.53–0.73) for outdoor PM 2.5 and 0.41 (99%CIs; 0.34–0.59) for outdoor NO 2 ; Pearson correlation analysis indicates a greater spatial modification of PM 2.5 exposure by housing (ρ = 0.81) than NO 2 (ρ = 0.88). For the demonstrative CO model, concentrations ranged from 0.4–9.9 ppm (99%CIs)(median = 3.0 ppm) in kitchens and 0.3–25.6 ppm (median = 6.4 ppm) in living rooms. Clusters of elevated indoor concentration are found in urban areas due to higher outdoor concentrations and smaller dwellings with reduced ventilation potential, with an estimated 17.6% increase in the number of living rooms and 63% increase in the number of kitchens exceeding recommended exposure levels following retrofit without additional ventilation. The model has the potential to rapidly calculate indoor pollution exposure across large housing stocks and estimate changes to exposure under different pollution or housing policy scenarios. © 2019

AB  - Operation of environmentally responsive building components requires rapid prediction of the optimal adaptation of geometric shapes and positions, and such responsive configuration needs to be identified during the design process as early as possible. However, building simulation practices to characterize optimized shapes of various geometric design candidates are limited by complex simulation procedures, slow optimization, and lack of site information. This study suggests a practical approach to the design of responsive building façades by integrating on-site sensors, building performance simulation (BPS), machine-learning, and 3D geometry modeling on a unified design interface. To this end, a novel and efficient hybrid optimization algorithm, tabu-based adaptive pattern search simulated annealing (T-APSSA), was developed and integrated with wireless sensor data communication (using nRF24L01 and ESP8266 WiFi modules) on a parametric visual programming language (VPL) interface Rhino Grasshopper (0.9.0076, McNeel, Seattle, USA). The effectiveness of T-APSSA for early-stage BPS and optimal design is compared with other metaheuristic algorithms, and the proposed framework is validated by experimental optimal envelope (window shading) designs for single (daylight) and multiple (daylight and energy) objectives. Test results demonstrate the improved efficiency of T-APSSA in calculations (two to four times faster than other algorithms). This T-APSSA-integrated sensor-enabled design optimization practice supports rapid BPS and digital prototyping of responsive building façade design. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - The UK government made significant commitments to upgrading the energy efficiency of seven million British homes by 2020, aiming at reducing carbon emissions and addressing fuel poverty. One alternative to achieve better energy performance in existing houses is retrofit. However, there are difficulties associated with retrofitting social housing. It is currently challenging to compare scenarios (retrofit options) considering costs, potential energy efficiency gains, and at the same time minimising disruption to users. This paper presents a Building Information Modelling (BIM) protocol aimed to support decision making by social housing owners. It adopts BIM to simulate alternative retrofit options, considering: (a) potential reductions in energy consumption, (b) 4D BIM for retrofit planning and reduction of users' disruption and (c) simulation of costs. A what-if scenario matrix is proposed to support decision making in the selection of social housing retrofit solutions, according to client and users' needs. A case study of the retrofit of a mid-terrace house is presented to demonstrate the workflow. The main output of the work is the BIM protocol, which can support client decision making in diverse social housing retrofit projects, considering all three elements (energy simulation, planning for reduced disruption and cost estimation) in an integrated fashion. Such an integrated approach enables clients to make better informed decisions considering diverse social housing retrofit options through a simple process using readily available BIM technology. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - The use of energy efficiency procedures is a typical practice in building construction process that creates a huge amount of data regarding the building. This is particularly valid in structures which include complex collaborations, for example, ventilation, sunlight-based increases, inner additions, and warm mass. This paper proposes a new approach for automating building construction when improving their energy efficiency, aiming to foresee comfort levels based on Heating, Ventilating, Air Conditioning (HVAC), constructive systems performance, environmental conditions, and occupant behavior. More specifically, it presents a research work about thermal performance of prefabricated construction systems developed by an Argentine enterprise called Astori, using two Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD) processes to extract knowledge. In this context, Building Information Modeling (BIM) will give data to support the calculation to outline goal levels of a sustainable building performance concerning classification systems. The data were collected from a project in Uruguay referring to the construction systems and the energy efficiency of the building. The data mining tool SPMF was used to test the performance of classification and its use in prediction. Particularly, FP-Growth Algorithm and Clustering methodologies were used to analyze a combination of ambient conditions, in order to compare them using Revit© software. The results generated by these methods can be generalized for a set of buildings, according to the objective to be achieved concerning the thermal building performance. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - European Architecture, Engineering and Construction (AEC) industry consumes a significant amount of materials like steel, aluminum, copper and plastics, thus creating a large reservoir on secondary raw materials in buildings. One of the main strategies to minimize environmental impacts and the energy consumption is maximizing recycling rates. To enable circularity, and in consequence high recycling rates, material information about the existing building stock is necessary. Therefore, new design-centric tools and methods, as well as tools, which enable a compilation of data repositories on the material composition of buildings, are required. The first aim of this research is the generation of a Building Information Modelling (BIM) - supported Material Passport (MP), which enables an assessment of the recycling potential and environmental impacts of building materials. For the compilation of the semi-automated MP, a specific methodology was developed and tested on a use case. Thereby various challenges regarding data and stakeholders were faced, such as inconsistent data and lack of collaboration between various stakeholders. These challenges lead to the second focus of this paper – the development of a data- and stakeholder management framework. The data- and stakeholder management framework presents the required collaboration of various stakeholders in order to achieve a successful implementation of the MP in the AEC industry. Results show, that a semi-automated compilation of the BIM-based MP is possible and the implementation of the MP in the AEC industry requires close collaboration of a broad spectrum of stakeholders, thus forming a need for creating digital platforms for life cycle management of buildings and material resources. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Buildings demand a significant amount of energy during their life cycles, hence, effective design measures need to be adopted to ensure efficient energy usage and management in buildings. This study proposes a framework based on various performance parameters to enable decision-makers utilizing standard procedures and software to empower the process of sustainable energy use and management in buildings, through a parametric analysis in different climatic conditions. Experimental design is adopted within the framework via the use of various performance parameters related to the building design (i.e., construction materials for exterior walls and roofs, as well as a set of window-to-wall ratios). Results indicate that climate data plays a fundamental role in the choice of design factors that are best suited for effective energy consumption in buildings. In particular, sub-type climate classifications, as opposed to the primary climate group, have a minor influence. Around 15% improvement in the energy consumption in buildings is noticed due to changes to the design factor such as the window-to-wall ratio. Insights that can be gleaned from this study include the impact of space area, exterior openings and material thickness and choice for the envelope of the building in all climate classifications, aiding in the design of low-energy buildings. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - A novel holistic framework was established using Building Information Modelling (BIM) to estimate accurately the potential of natural ventilation of residential high-rise buildings. This framework integrates Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulation, multi-zone-air-flow modelling, and Building Energy Simulation (BES) to calculate ventilation rates under the mechanisms of wind-, buoyancy- and wind and buoyancy-driven ventilation. The framework was applied to a 40-storey residential building in Hong Kong for estimating the potential of natural ventilation in residential high-rise buildings. The results show that the building can save up to 25% of the electricity consumption if the building employs wind-driven natural ventilation instead of mechanical ventilation. The electricity consumption can be further reduced up to 45% by facilitating the buoyancy-driven natural ventilation. However, natural ventilation is found to be effective only if the temperature difference between indoor and outdoor is less than 2 °C. The study suggests to orienting residential high-rise buildings at an oblique angle with the prevalent wind direction than positioning perpendicular to the prevalent wind direction. Furthermore, the framework recommends promoting the wind-driven natural ventilation at top floors of residential high-rise buildings and to facilitate wind and buoyancy-driven natural ventilation at middle and lower floors of the buildings. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Information needs for progressive BIM methodology supporting the holistic energy renovation of office buildings
PY  - 2019
AU  - Stegnar, G.
AU  - Cerovšek, T.
AB  - The paper presents digital methodology that can gradually and efficiently streamline the energy renovation of office buildings. Building Information Modelling (BIM) and energy simulations are widely used to facilitate informed decision-making. Significant data collections may be accrued that do not meet the information needs of energy renovation design, performance evaluation, (re)construction and operations. Ineffective managed information often leads to sub-standard project deliverables, re-work, errors, budget deficits, and delays. The progressive BIM methodology proposed suggests specifying adequate information to match the purpose of an evolving renovation design process - with emphasis on energy performance - while addressing aspects of multiple sustainability. This approach is based on firm methodological principles and validated on the actual refurbishment of office buildings. Results show that progressive BIM methodology can improve design, more accurately predict energy consumption, reduce investment costs, prevent design and planning errors, and prevent construction delays. This study is a valuable contribution to renovation design research and development, especially to practitioners (architects and engineers) in aligning client requirements and design and project outcomes, with clear profiling of the information requirements for different levels of design services in renovations. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The enrichment in building operation data has enabled the development of advanced data-driven methods for building energy predictions. Existing studies mainly focused on the utilization of supervised learning techniques for model development, while overlooking the significance of feature engineering. Feature engineering are helpful for reducing data dimensionality, decreasing prediction model complexity, and tackling the problem of corrupted and noisy information. Considering that each building has unique operating characteristics, it is neither practical nor efficient to manually identify features for model developments. Data-driven feature engineering methods are thus needed to ensure the flexibility and generalization of building energy prediction models. Using operation data of real buildings, this paper investigates the performance of different deep learning techniques in automatically deriving high-quality features for building energy predictions. Three types of deep learning-based features are developed using fully-connected autoencoders, convolutional autoencoders and generative adversarial networks respectively. Their potentials in building energy predictions have been exploited and compared with conventional feature engineering methods. The study validates the usefulness of deep learning in enhancing building energy prediction performance. The research results help to automate and improve the predictive modeling process while bridging the knowledge gaps between deep learning and building professionals. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Risk model for energy performance contracting in correctional facilities
PY  - 2019
AU  - Berghorn, G.H.
AU  - Syal, M.
AB  - Energy performance contracting provides guaranteed minimum energy savings to building owners, enabling them to finance project costs using utility savings over the duration of the project. This has been an attractive project delivery method for organizations with reduced budgets for capital projects, particularly among correctional facilities which frequently have lengthy periods of deferred maintenance and ongoing building operations and maintenance concerns. This research builds on a previously developed project factors risk framework for energy service companies undertaking building retrofits. This paper proposes a risk analysis and evaluation model that includes quantitative, expert-based, and probabilistically derived information. Expected cost was used to evaluate risks over lengthy project life cycles and a new metric was developed for use in the model-expected life cycle value. Model results reveal that the most critical risk factors relate to the reduced availability of “low-hanging fruit” energy conservation measures, work scopes based on traditional design-bid-build procurement, unavailable or inaccurate facility information, facility age and current code requirements, and conducting the investment grade audit too quickly. The life cycle cost-based risk model employed in this paper is proposed as an advancement over traditional risk management methods, and it is expected to be applicable, with modification, across other municipal and state government subdomains, especially high security projects. © 2019, College Publishing.

TI  - A meta-model approach for formal specification and consistent management of multi-LOD building models
PY  - 2019
AU  - Abualdenien, J.
AU  - Borrmann, A.
AB  - The design of a building is a collaborative process among experts from multiple disciplines. Using Building Information Modeling (BIM), a model is developed through multiple refinement stages to satisfy various design and engineering requirements. Such refinements of geometric and semantic information are described as levels of development (LOD). Thus far, there is no method to explicitly define an LOD's requirements nor to precisely specify the uncertainties involved. Furthermore, despite the insufficient information in the early design stages, a BIM model appears precise and certain, which can lead to false assumptions and model evaluations, for example, in the case of energy efficiency calculations or structural analyses. Hence, this paper presents a multi-LOD meta-model to explicitly describe an LOD's requirements, incorporating the potential fuzziness of both, geometric and semantic information of individual elements. The explicitly defined fuzziness can be taken into account when applying simulations or analyses for assessing the performance of different building design variants. To support the continuous elaboration of a building from the conceptual to the detailed design stages, the multi-LOD model makes it possible to ensure the consistency of the geometric and semantic information as well as the topological coherence across the different LODs. The feasibility of the approach is demonstrated by its prototypical implementation as a web-server and user-interface, providing a means for managing and checking the exchange requirements both at the meta-level and for concrete building model instances. The paper is concluded with a case study of a real-world construction project that demonstrates the use of the meta-model to support model analysis and the decision-making process. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Energy-efficient renovation of buildings is in a major role in achieving the climate targets. Refurbishment at district scale may contain several benefits compared to mere building renovations, such as reduced costs due to smaller unit costs. Furthermore, it provides municipalities better opportunities to implement energy and sustainability strategies. This paper introduces a district-scale procedure for analyzing energy-efficient refurbishment of buildings. The main targets for the developed procedure were: 1) easy way for feeding information, 2) dynamic calculation capacity, and 3) support for decision makers. In order to support the targets, the procedure combines energy simulation, 3D data modelling and visualization. Additionally, CityGML is utilized to receive building related district data. The procedure was tested in a Finnish case district where altogether six realistic refurbishment scenarios were compared by means of operational costs, energy usages and CO 2 emissions. The test analyses demonstrates that different scenarios may have conflicting impacts which give important information to the decision-makers. The procedure is not limited to the demonstrated scenarios but it can be modified for different purposes. Additionally, the procedure was compared to other district-level procedures identified from the literature. The procedure turned out to be a promising basis for assessing district-scale energy renovation alternatives. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Understanding the energy demand of a city’s housing stock is an important focus for local and national administrations to identify strategies for reducing carbon emissions. Building energy simulation offers a promising approach to understand energy use and test plans to improve the efficiency of residential properties. As part of this, models of the urban stock must be created that accurately reflect its size, shape and composition. However, substantial effort is required in order to generate detailed urban scenes with the appropriate level of attribution suitable for spatially explicit simulation of large areas. Furthermore, the computational complexity of microsimulation of building energy necessitates consideration of approaches that reduce this processing overhead. We present a workflow to automatically generate 2.5D urban scenes for residential building energy simulation from UK mapping datasets. We describe modelling the geometry, the assignment of energy characteristics based upon a statistical model and adopt the CityGML EnergyADE schema which forms an important new and open standard for defining energy model information at the city-scale. We then demonstrate use of the resulting urban scenes for estimating heating demand using a spatially explicit building energy microsimulation tool, called CitySim+, and evaluate the effects of an off-the-shelf geometric simplification routine to reduce simulation computational complexity. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - Building on the substantial progress that has been made in using free energy perturbation (FEP) methods to predict the relative binding affinities of small molecule ligands to proteins, we have previously shown that results of similar quality can be obtained in predicting the effect of mutations on the binding affinity of protein–protein complexes. However, these results were restricted to mutations which did not change the net charge of the side chains due to known difficulties with modeling perturbations involving a change in charge in FEP. Various methods have been proposed to address this problem. Here we apply the co-alchemical water approach to study the efficacy of FEP calculations of charge changing mutations at the protein–protein interface for the antibody–gp120 system investigated previously and three additional complexes. We achieve an overall root mean square error of 1.2 kcal/mol on a set of 106 cases involving a change in net charge selected by a simple suitability filter using side-chain predictions and solvent accessible surface area to be relevant to a biologic optimization project. Reasonable, although less precise, results are also obtained for the 44 more challenging mutations that involve buried residues, which may in some cases require substantial reorganization of the local protein structure, which can extend beyond the scope of a typical FEP simulation. We believe that the proposed prediction protocol will be of sufficient efficiency and accuracy to guide protein engineering projects for which optimization and/or maintenance of a high degree of binding affinity is a key objective. © 2019 The Authors

TI  - BIM’s social role in building energy modeling
PY  - 2019
AU  - Maskil-Leitan, R.
AU  - Reychav, I.
AB  - With increasing awareness of the contribution of buildings to global warming, the construction industry has begun to be more responsive to energy-efficient buildings. The emergence of building information modeling (BIM) with building energy modeling (BEM) provides industry with means to address related issues through integrated energy analysis of buildings. Nevertheless, connecting BIM technology to BEM includes issues of information exchange among the participants in the process. While the prevailing view in the literature is that there is a need to redefine the process, it is suggested that beyond that the success of BEM includes stakeholder management, which can be implemented through BIM’s social capabilities. Therefore, in order to address the integration issues between them, this study proposes a social concept for connecting BIM to BEM, which is reflected in the model for implementation of corporate social responsibility (CSR) through BIM for BEM (CSR–BIM–BEM model). The examination of the relevance of BIM’s social capabilities to the BEM process according to this model was conducted on three levels. First, the implications of integrating BIM technology into the BEM process were examined through expert interviews, and the need for social perception became apparent. Second, the examination of the model’s criteria by the experts supported its ability to promote the BEM process. Third, an examination of two case studies proved, using social network analysis and participant interviews, the model’s feasibility, in terms of BEM process parameters. A direct link was found between BIM’s management centrality, reflected in BIM involvement in stakeholder management, and progress in the BEM process. These results illustrate the importance of BIM’s social role in building energy modeling.

AB  - Ventilation systems are critically important components of many public buildings and workspaces. Proper ventilation is often crucial for preventing accidents, such as explosions in mines and avoiding health issues, for example, through long-term exposure to harmful respirable matter. Validation and maintenance of ventilation systems is thus of key interest for plant operators and authorities. However, methods for ventilation characterization, which allow us to monitor whether the ventilation system in place works as desired, hardly exist. This article addresses the critical challenge of ventilation characterization—measuring and modelling air flow at micro-scales—that is, creating a high-resolution model of wind speed and direction from airflow measurements. Models of the near-surface micro-scale flow fields are not only useful for ventilation characterization, but they also provide critical information for planning energy-efficient paths for aerial robots and many applications in mobile robot olfaction. In this article we propose a heterogeneous measurement system composed of static, continuously sampling sensing nodes, complemented by localized measurements, collected during occasional sensing missions with a mobile robot. We introduce a novel, data-driven, multi-domain airflow modelling algorithm that estimates (1) fields of posterior distributions over wind direction and speed (“ventilation maps”, spatial domain); (2) sets of ventilation calendars that capture the evolution of important airflow characteristics at measurement positions (temporal domain); and (3) a frequency domain analysis that can reveal periodic changes of airflow in the environment. The ventilation map and the ventilation calendars make use of an improved estimation pipeline that incorporates a wind sensor model and a transition model to better filter out sporadic, noisy airflow changes. These sudden changes may originate from turbulence or irregular activity in the surveyed environment and can, therefore, disturb modelling of the relevant airflow patterns. We tested the proposed multi-domain airflow modelling approach with simulated data and with experiments in a semi-controlled environment and present results that verify the accuracy of our approach and its sensitivity to different turbulence levels and other disturbances. Finally, we deployed the proposed system in two different real-world industrial environments (foundry halls) with different ventilation regimes for three weeks during full operation. Since airflow ground truth cannot be obtained, we present a qualitative discussion of the generated airflow models with plant operators, who concluded that the computed models accurately depicted the expected airflow patterns and are useful to understand how pollutants spread in the work environment. This analysis may then provide the basis for decisions about corrective actions to avoid long-term exposure of workers to harmful respirable matter. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - The BIM-based Material Passport as optimization tool. The construction sector ranks among the biggest consumers of raw materials and is responsible for 40 % of CO 2 -emissions, which requires an urgent optimization in terms of sustainability. Maximizing the recycling rates in the construction sector is therefore one of the main strategies of the EU for minimizing the resources consumption as well as the ecological impacts and energy consumption. For enabling efficient recycling, detailed knowledge about the existing stocks and embedded materials is crucial, which is usually not available. In this article the concept of the Material Passport (MP) is presented, which is conceptualized for the evaluation of the recycling potential as well as the ecological impacts. Moreover, the MP consists of all materials as well as their properties and serves as optimization tool in early design stages. In our research a BIM-based MP for optimization of design regarding resources efficiency and ecological footprint was created. Thereby the structure and methodology for the MP as well as the workflow for the semi-automated generation were developed and verified through a use case. Results show, that the developed methodology for compiling the MP and for the evaluation of embedded materials in buildings works properly. Further, the MP represents an important decision tool in early design stages. © 2019, Ernst und Sohn. All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper tackles the issue of frost formation in air-to-air heat recovery devices dedicated to single room ventilation by means of both numerical simulations and experimental approaches. In such heat exchangers, it is commonly known that the formation of a frost layer on the surface generates an additional thermal resistance and a flow section reduction, which leads to an overall degradation of the overall unit performance. This paper proposes a three-zone model, considering a dry, a wet and a frost zone, by determining the location of moving boundaries. Each zone is handled independently and the relative proportion of each zone is determined by means of the exchanger wall temperature. Besides this frost model, a defrost model is also envisaged. Once validated with experimental data collected on a U-flow-type heat exchanger, the developed model is used to implement different strategies to reduce or prevent frost formation in the exchanger. Based on three different criteria, these strategies are compared with each other to evaluate their benefits and drawbacks. The criteria give information on the energy efficiency of the ventilation, on the air renewal quality and on the pressure balance between the inside and the outside of the building. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The energy performance gap is one of the most discussed issues in the design community since energy modeling became an integral part of the building design process. Different limitations apply to almost every building performance simulation (BPS) software available today and to have confidence in the predictions of whole-building energy models it is necessary to have a thorough understanding of various features, specific capabilities, and disadvantages of BPS tools. The main contribution of this work is the use of three methods of evaluation with different levels of complexity, free-floating, ideal air load system, and detailed method to analyze and compare the capabilities of EnergyPlus and IES to model complex LEED silver multi-purpose university building. Consequently, this study provides new information regarding capabilities of two extensively used BPS tools to model advanced and innovative buildings, and in particular HVAC systems that are increasingly becoming used in high-performance commercial and institutional buildings worldwide. The difference between the total energy consumptions of the EnergyPlus and IES models developed according to the final construction drawings was approximately 2.1%, whereas differences between the heating and cooling loads of the EnergyPlus and IES models with ideal air load systems were 6 MWh (1.7%) and 0.86 MWh (7.8%), respectively. The high consistency between the models’ aggregated predictions are particularly pertinent and encouraging for certification programs such as LEED, which take into account aggregated energy consumption data in their assessments. The findings also emphasize the importance of the modeler's assumptions regarding the modeling of HVAC systems and their impact on the model's predictions. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The building sector is responsible for a major share of energy consumption, with the most energy being consumed during the operation stage of buildings. Energy-efficiency retrofit (EER) policies have been promoted by numerous countries. However, the effectiveness of these incentive policies has been insufficient, a main reason being the agency problem between the government and building owners. In addition, most policies ignored the diversity of buildings and building owners, resulting in a lack of reaction from owners. To address this problem, this study proposed an agent-based model for policy making on EER. The model defined the government and owners as agents and their decision-making behaviors were modeled with principal-agent theory. A platform based on the proposed model was then developed and the incentive policy was optimized under different circumstances. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed model, three policy scenarios were compared on the platform, which are the policy by the proposed model, the incentive policy in Shanghai and Shenzhen, China. The results showed that the incentive policy based on the proposed model has the best performance on energy savings, returns on investment, and leverage effects. A sensitivity analysis indicated that the government should pay more attention to energy price. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - City districts have a large potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by usage of energy efficiency measures. Urban energy models (UEM) can be useful to analyze the impact of different energy efficiency actions on city districts. While simulation of demand data with high spatial and temporal resolution is often necessary to evaluate retrofit measures, the city's complex structure and lack of data often prevents a reliable application of such methods. This paper presents an urban energy modeling approach based on open-source geographical information system (GIS) datasets to reduce input data uncertainty and simplify city district modeling. We present a method to automatically extract basic city district data from OpenStreetMap (OSM) and enrich these datasets based on national building stock statistics. Building models with representative geometries and physical properties are automatically generated based on building archetype information. These models enable thermal simulation on urban scale. The approach is demonstrated for a use case in Germany, where a reference city district model has been generated with OSM data extraction and enrichment. The reference city district model has been used to perform a space heating net energy demand uncertainty analysis. The demand values simulated with the reference model show a sufficient fit with measured consumption values. The approach provides a fast and structured methodology to model city districts and simulate space heating energy demand on urban scale. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The MESSAGE Integrated Assessment Model (IAM) developed by IIASA has been a central tool of energy-environment-economy systems analysis in the global scientific and policy arena. It played a major role in the Assessment Reports of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC); it provided marker scenarios of the Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) and the Shared Socio-Economic Pathways (SSPs); and it underpinned the analysis of the Global Energy Assessment (GEA). Alas, to provide relevant analysis for current and future challenges, numerical models of human and earth systems need to support higher spatial and temporal resolution, facilitate integration of data sources and methodologies across disciplines, and become open and transparent regarding the underlying data, methods, and the scientific workflow. In this manuscript, we present the building blocks of a new framework for an integrated assessment modeling platform; the “ecosystem” comprises: i) an open-source GAMS implementation of the MESSAGE energy++ system model integrated with the MACRO economic model; ii) a Java/database back-end for version-controlled data management, iii) interfaces for the scientific programming languages Python & R for efficient input data and results processing workflows; and iv) a web-browser-based user interface for model/scenario management and intuitive “drag-and-drop” visualization of results. The framework aims to facilitate the highest level of openness for scientific analysis, bridging the need for transparency with efficient data processing and powerful numerical solvers. The platform is geared towards easy integration of data sources and models across disciplines, spatial scales and temporal disaggregation levels. All tools apply best-practice in collaborative software development, and comprehensive documentation of all building blocks and scripts is generated directly from the GAMS equations and the Java/Python/R source code. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In the Internet of Things (IoT)-supported energy data management infrastructure, objects from various energy generation and consumption terminals in buildings produce a tremendous amount of data. However, this data is not useful unless it is available on-time for services that discover meaningful information in order to provide intelligent decisions. The microservices-based data caching, data virtualization, data processing, data analysis, and data ingestion methods can be applied to enhance the data availability for energy efficiency management services provision across buildings. To foster building energy efficiency management services (BEEMS), Web of Objects (WoO) provides data abstraction, aggregation, and ingestion mechanism with virtual objects (VOs) and composite virtual objects (CVOs) by using ontologies and availability and scalability of services with microservices. This article proposes the use of data processing microservices modeling to enhance data availability and expose services capabilities with microservices for BEEMS. We present a semantic web agent based on an ontology for linking, enhancement, reusability, and availability of data-objects, services, and microservices. For the evaluation, we present a use case, which includes heterogeneous data collection and processing and provision of various BEEMS. A prototype for the use case scenario has been built and the results have been evaluated in the laboratory to mimic the enhanced data availability for BEEMS. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - HVAC is one of the largest consumers of electrical energy in residential and commercial buildings. Reducing of consumption of energy without compromising thermal comfort may have environmental and financial benefits. Thermal comfort expresses satisfaction with the thermal environment is one of the parameters necessary in building style that in depth modeling and standardization exist. in commercial buildings if thermal comfort is not satisfactory that may effect on human life, which may cause problematic behavior that forms a heavy burden for skilled and informal careers day and night. The main energy consumption contribution within the operation section of contemporary buildings is from their HVAC systems. Tactically HVAC systems could offer healthy and comfortable indoor surroundings, whereas poor design could result in wastage of energy. Historically the look of the systems relies on a continuing range of occupants whereas the situational awareness of the system has been unnoticed. This paper focuses on the investigating of the HVAC system in terms of its information of the occupants of the power in real time. Thermal comfort analysis is applied to check the indoor climate of buildings for economical use of such HVAC systems. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) is used to model and simulate the indoor conditions. Pro-E software used for Building information Modeling (BIM) to be a platform to integrate all the information of commercial building standards, and using of CFD software check the inside thermal comfort levels and energy distribution at inside the room. © TJPRC Pvt.

AB  - Virtual design tools and methods can aid in creating decision bases, but it is a challenge to balance all the trade-offs between different disciplines in building design. Optimization methods are at hand, but the question is how to connect and coordinate the updating of the domain models of each discipline and centralize the product definition into one source instead of having several unconnected product definitions. Building information modelling (BIM) features the idea of centralizing the product definition to a BIM-model and creating interoperability between models from different domains and previous research reports on different applications in a number of fields within construction. Recent research features BIM-based optimization, but there is still a question of knowing how to design a BIM-based process using neutral file formats to enable multidisciplinary optimization of life-cycle energy and cost. This paper proposes a framework for neutral BIM-based multidisciplinary optimization. The framework consists of (1) a centralized master model, from which different discipline-specific domain models are generated and evaluated; and (2) an optimization algorithm controlling the optimization loop. Based on the proposed framework, a prototype was developed and used in a case study of a Swedish multifamily residential building to test the framework's applicability in generating and optimizing multiple models based on the BIM-model. The prototype was developed to enhance the building's sustainability performance by optimizing the trade-off between the building's life-cycle energy (LCE) and life-cycle cost (LCC) when choosing material for the envelope. The results of the case study demonstrated the applicability of the framework and prototype in optimizing the trade-off between conflicting objectives, such as LCE and LCC, during the design process. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - Energy renovations offer unique opportunities to increase the energy efficiency of the built environment and for the existing housing stock; they are the most important solution. Usually, energy savings are based on modeling calculations. However, recent research has shown that the predicted energy consumption differs largely from the actual consumption. In this paper, the effectiveness of energy measures is re-assessed based on actual consumption data. We use a monitoring system, which contains information about the energy performance of around 60% of the Dutch non-profit housing sector (circa 1.2 million dwellings). We connect the data from this monitoring system to actual energy consumption data from Statistics Netherlands on a dwelling level. Using longitudinal analysis methods, from 2010 to 2014, we are able to identify the energy efficiency improvements of the stock and determine the effectiveness of different measures in terms of actual energy savings. The results reveal the actual energy savings of different efficiency measures and highlight the significance of the actual energy consumption when a renovation is planned or realized. © 2018, The Author(s).

AB  - Owners of large building portfolios such as university campuses have long relied on building energy models to predict potential energy savings from various efficiency upgrades. Traditional calibration procedures for individual building model are time intensive and require specially trained personnel, making their applications to campuses with hundreds of buildings prohibitive. Recently proposed automatic calibration techniques reduce the manual effort during calibration but require hundreds of thousands of energy simulations which increase their cost. To reduce the computational effort of these methods, this paper proposes a methodology that uses a data-driven approximation technique. Instead of brute-force simulations using detailed engineering models, this study employs statistical surrogate models with an optimization algorithm to estimate properties of unknown building parameters. Results demonstrate that when envelope information is available, this workflow yields sufficiently accurate estimates of hard to observe building characteristics, about 500 times faster than traditional approaches. © 2018, © 2018 International Building Performance Simulation Association (IBPSA).

AB  - Building energy-performance simulation programs are powerful tools for many aspects of feasibility studies regarding ground source heat pump (GSHP). However, the understanding of the limitations of the energy modelling programs, their capability of predicting energy performance early in the design process, and the complicated functionality of these programs makes the software programs harder to use and less practical. The interactive tool developed in this study seeks to provide analysis information in a straightforward manner that is inexpensive, convenient, and sophisticated. This tool uses an inclusive approach to assess the feasibility of GSHPs by prescreening critical factors such as climate conditions, ground temperatures, energy use, and cost savings. It is interactive and enables the user to do a feasibility analysis with a weighting factor for each feasibility criterion based on the user’s preference and interests. The application of the tool explains feasibility scores of 15 representative cities in various climatic conditions across the US. Results for commercial buildings show that the GSHP systems are more feasible in cold and dry, cool and humid, and very cold areas than warm and dry, very hot and humid, and mixed marine areas, and that most feasibility levels are located on good and moderate. © 2017, © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Green envelope plays an important role to regulate the indoor environment for the temperate climate. However, in the case of hot and humid climate such as Malaysia, the benefits of having green envelopes need further quantitative investigations due to limited published literature. Incorporating green envelope during the design phase of an air-conditioned library could potentially improve its indoor thermal comfort, provide a pleasant indoor environment with reduced energy consumption. Hence, this study aims to analyse how green envelope options affect the Energy Usage Index (EUI) of a two-level library. This study employs a quantitative approach using Revit Building Information Modelling (BIM) simulation software. Variations in the building parameters simulated are building orientation, envelope material, thermal insulation, and envelope treatment. The study outcome indicates that various permutations of the green envelope presented various impacts on the EUI of the library. The double-glazed windows and green roof contributed a substantial improvement on the EUI indicated by the lowest mean EUI of 188 and 193 kWh/m2/year respectively compared with the control building that recorded a mean EUI of 226 kWh/m2/year. This study verifies the benefits of the green envelope as a strategy for energy efficiency. The credible results also support the application of building simulation to improve envelope design and to predict the possible outcomes of design alternatives before the building is constructed. © 2019, Construction Research Institute of Malaysia.

AB  - Increasing energy efficiency in buildings is a crucial topic, especially in those EU countries where almost 50% of the final energy consumption is used for space heating and cooling, of which 80% is used for buildings. This study presents a model and a tool that can be used to evaluate energy consumption and to identify retrofitting strategies and renewable energy sources with the aim of reaching energy and climate targets in order to improve energy security, competitiveness and sustainability in a territory. In a previous research, a ‘top-down engineering’ model was applied for a number of 1 km2 districts in the city of Turin (IT) to evaluate the residual potential of buildings that could be connected to the district heating network. In this work, the energy-use model has been improved by considering applications to urban areas of different dimensions, and an urban energy atlas for the Turin building stock has been defined with the support of a Geographical Information System. The model has been validated by comparing the results of an energy balance calculation with energy consumption data of three consecutive heating seasons over an area of about 40 km2 in which 500,000 inhabitants live. © 2019 International Information and Engineering Technology Association.

AB  - Despite the international trend of actively utilizing BIM in the field of energy simulation, it is difficult to actively utilize BIM in domestic certification-related practice. As a result, the work process is not integrated and the work efficiency is reduced, such as the occurrence of redundant tasks. In this paper, the integrated process based on the BIM geometry information automated extraction module was presented and its effectiveness was reviewed and verified through self-developed automation module and uniformity and error-causing analysis. The construction of an integrated process through automatic configuration information extraction has the advantages of reducing the workload, enabling additional tasks through module function expansion, sharing information through the web, and ease of service manufacture. In addition, an experiment comparing the data of automatic and manual calculations with three subjects confirmed that automatic calculation database through automation module can produce a more reliable and uniform database with a lower proportion of human error than the manual calculation module. This not only improves the reliability of the energy simulation itself, but also reduces the human and temporal loads that occur during the post-simulation data verification process. © 2019 by the authors.

This data can not only be used to plan and construct a building but to design the controls for heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems. The relevant information about the building and its systems is used as the base for controller design, opening new opportunities like the automated testing and optimization of control strategies, both for energy efficiency and user comfort. This paper shows how the information in the BIM is used to design control strategies, including a completeness check and a resulting data set enhancement of this necessary information. It also shows a way, how a building, which is already operating, can be optimized using the operation data from energy systems to modify the existing controllers. The methodology is executed using a ventilation system that provides air quality by means of CO2-driven control. © 2013 IEEE.

TI  - Application of spiking neural networks for modeling the process of high-temperature hydrogen production in systems with gas-cooled reactors

AU  - Starkov, S.O.

AB  - The article considers a simulated possible scenario for the joint production of hydrogen and electrical energy using a high-temperature gas-cooled reactor. The considered model is based on a neural network system, which is used as a technological tool for generating control signals. The multi-layer direct-acting neural network is composed of spiking neural elements, the architecture of which is based on interacting reverberation loops. The electro-optical commuting system considered in this article is the base for building a switching communication system between neurons. The use of optical communication and liquid crystal modulators simplifies the mass distribution of a signal to many neurons from different populations and the change of its parameters. This property is necessary to ensure the neural controller high performance. The approximating properties of a neural network are used to control a group of dual electrolytic cells. Each electrolyzer has a set of variables controlling the temperature, chemical composition and current density through the cell. The spiking network, exerting a control action on pairs of electrolytic cells, completely controls the process of low-temperature electrolysis in a copper sulfate solution. The amounts of hydrogen produced at the cathodes of the grouped electrolyzers will be proportional to the amount of gas produced by the high-temperature electrolysis systems, in which nuclear reactors are the sources of thermal and electrical energy. Information coding is carried out by sequences of spiking pulses from groups of 4 neurons. This method of representing the control sequence elements minimizes a false change in the parameters of low-temperature electrolysis. Learning of the neural network system is carried out by a scattered search algorithm. The evaluation of the simulation efficiency has shown the feasibility of constructing hybrid models with a neural network control system, which do not require the use of expensive materials. © 2019 Obninsk Institute for Nuclear Power Engineering, National Research Nuclear University 'MEPhI'.

AB  - In recent years an increase of interest in usage of renewable energy sources as a substitution of fossil fuels is being noticeable. However, the waste heat potential, which can be used as an additional source of energy for heating water in buildings, is being omitted. The sources of this heat can be grey water discharged from such sanitary facilities as showers or washing machines. In response to this issue, we took on the task to define and analyze key factors affecting the development of DWHR (Drain Water Heat Recovery) systems using PESTLE (political, economic, social, technological, legal and environmental) analysis. The strengths and weaknesses of these systems were also identified. The studies were based on CFD (computational fluid dynamics) modeling tools. In the Autodesk Simulation CFD software environment, a DWHR unit was made, which was then analyzed for heat exchange efficiency. The obtained results were the basis for preparing the strategy for the development of Drain Water Heat Recovery systems. It was made using the SWOT/TOWS (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats/threats, opportunities, weaknesses and strengths) method, which precisely orders information and allows presenting the project characteristic in readable way for a recipient. The results of the conducted analysis indicated the lack of acceptance on the part of potential users and the resulting need to promote the use of Drain Water Heat Recovery systems at residential level. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - Enormously increased energy consumption makes it inevitable to upgrade the energy efficiency of the existing stock of buildings which share a substantial part of the overall energy consumption worldwide. Being an effective tool for analyzing energy performance, Building Information Modelling (BIM), is used to enhance the energy performance of the buildings. This study, therefore, investigates the effectiveness of applying passive cooling techniques using BIM and focuses on developing recommendations on feasible and optimized retrofitting techniques for existing buildings. Moreover, it gives an economic comparison between initial investment and returns based on the quantitative results of energy retrofitting. Thermal simulation software Autodesk Ecotect has been used to simulate annual energy consumption of one case building. Different passive cooling techniques have been applied according to Building Energy Codes of Pakistan. The input parameters are, thus, type of insulating material, the thickness of insulating materials, single and double glazing of windows and window to wall ratio. Results indicate that the annual energy consumption of selected building can be reduced up to 35 % when building incorporates passive cooling techniques with a calculated payback period of 3 years and 2 months. © 2019, International Journal Of Renewable Energy Research.

AB  - In response to the increased energy consumption in residential buildings, various efforts have been devoted to increase occupant awareness using energy feedback systems. However, it was shown that the feedback provided by these systems is not enough to inform occupant actions to reduce energy consumption. Another approach is to control energy consumption using automated energy management systems. The automatic control of appliances takes out the occupant sense of control, which is proved to be uncomfortable in many cases. This paper proposes an energy messaging intervention that keeps the control for occupants while supporting them with actionable messages. The messages inform occupants about energy waste incidents happening in their house in real time, which enables occupants to take actions to reduce their consumption. Besides, a heuristic is defined to make the intervention non-intrusive by controlling the rate and time of the messages sent to occupants. The proposed intervention is evaluated in a novel layered agent-based model. The first layer of the model generates the detailed energy consumption and realistic occupant activities. The second layer is designed to simulate the peer pressure effect on the energy consumption behavior of the individuals. The third layer is a customizable layer that simulates energy interventions. The implemented intervention in this paper is the proposed non-intrusive messaging intervention. A number of scenarios are presented in the experiments to show how the model can be used to evaluate the proposed intervention and achieve energy efficiency targets. © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - Energy Management and Information Systems are a family of analytics technologies that include energy information systems, fault detection and diagnostics (FDD), and automated system optimization tools. Such systems have the potential to enable buildings to meet energy management goals of reducing total energy consumption and cost. Most current market offerings use data-driven and rule-based analytics. However, the use of physics-based models in the analytics offers potential improvements by providing an accurate estimation of outputs based on representation of the physical principles governing the building system behaviors. This also permits the use of design stage models to inform commissioning and operation. This paper describes the development and testing of a hybrid data-driven and physics model-based operational tool for energy efficiency in central cooling plants. The tool offers FDD functionality, setpoint optimization, and visualization of key performance parameters. It was demonstrated at a university campus in the mixed-humid ASHRAE Climate Zone 4A. Key performance metrics that were analyzed include plant electricity use reduction, plant model calibration, and system economics. Annual simulations indicate the tool can provide electricity savings of greater than 10% for approximately six months of the year, mainly during the winter season when wet bulb temperatures are low, though only 1.38% savings for the entire year. Additionally, over a 4-day period in April, recommended optimal setpoints were implemented, resulting in 17% savings versus metered baseline consumption. With respect to model calibration, the difference between model-predicted and measured parameters was less than 10% for 90% of data points acquired for three of six chillers, and for each ten cooling towers. Finally, the tool users reported that satisfaction with the capabilities was equal to or better than that with the preexisting BAS system. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Our goal in this contribution is to study and formulate different scenarios that will aid in identifying opportunities to increase environmental and energy sustainability of the urban environment of a tropical coastal city. These cities are among the most vulnerable to climate change and impacts on the energy infrastructures are particularly concerning. For this effort, the Weather Research and Forecast (WRF) model, with the Building Effect Parameterization and Building Energy Model (BEP-BEM) schemes are applied to the tropical coastal San Juan Metropolitan Area (SJMA) in Puerto Rico. SJMA has a total population of 2.0 million inhabitants in a total area of 750 km2. Building use and heights required for BEP-BEM are estimated from the World Urban Database Access Portal Tool (WUDAPT), Local Climate Zones (LCZs) classification, which partitions the urban landscape into ten different urban classes. WUDAPT output was compared with observations from the NASA ATLAS Mission and NASA Landsat 8 imagery, and was found to be in good resemblance for their urban built up class. To test energy use and mitigation strategies for SJMA, we consider the heat wave event from 09-29-2014 to 10-02-2014. The new modeling methodology (BEP-BEM-WUDAPT) was found to improve results from non-urbanized versions when compared with observations from a network of weather stations. Air conditioning (AC) demand from urban WRF was found to be in good agreement with EnergyPlus™ simulations and available records from the local power utility company. The work explored building energy sustainability and mitigating options to include energy efficient building materials, white roofs, increase of indoor AC temperature set points, and use of high efficiency AC equipment. Among mitigating alternatives explored, results show that white roofs, target indoor temperatures and high efficient AC systems reduce the total energy demand by 6.9%, 9.9% and 16.15%, respectively. Furthermore, when considering all alternatives simultaneously, the peak demand decreased by 40% during a tropical heat wave event. © 2018 The Authors

AB  - The use of Building Information Modelling (BIM) is getting more and more popular since governments worldwide are increasing the demand of this methodology as a requirement in their projects. One of the most encouraging ways to promote the use of this methodology is based on the so-called BIM contests, where practitioners are challenged to build a virtual model of a structure collaboratively. These challenges are usually designed to take the participants out of their comfort zone and to encourage them to experiment in the use of the latest software and collaborative software connections. Unlike other activities encouraging BIM, these contests have the additional advantage of easing the comparison in terms of software, exchange file formats and information flows as all the proposals are framed into a common project with the same working time. Despite the interest of this kind of comparative analyses, no studies of the results of BIM contest proposals can be found in the literature. To fill this gap, this paper analyses the summary reports of the different proposals submitted in three editions (2014, 2015 and 2016) of the BIM Valladolid contest in Spain. The results of this study provide usefull insights into the use of software in a number of disciplines (Architecture, Structural Analysis, Energy Efficiency, Measurements and Budget, Facilities, Planning Execution and Coordination) and the most common file exchange formats. The evolution of teams in software use throughout the different contest editions as well as the information flow among the Architecture and the Structural Analysis disciplines are also analyzed. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Inspection of sustainable performance during post-construction has become increasingly essential. However, conventional operation and maintenance processes are limited with a high probability of inaccurate manual building inspections and the lack of real-time input of dynamic factors. In this regard, engagement of an Integrated Knowledge-based Building Management System using nD BIM applications (nD BIM-IKBMS) is anticipated to promote promising resolutions. The proposed system is expected to provide simulation-based supervisory control while automatically detecting and diagnosing operational faults. Following the literature-based conceptual model developed in our past research, this study aims to generate and verify the proposed framework theoretically, as the second step of nD BIM-IKBMS research and development series, concentrating on functional modeling. Notwithstanding which, it is difficult to describe a cross-disciplinary system following a single framework. As the technology evolves, the framework can not be generalized into new scenarios. Towards this end, the study is followed through the complexity theory lens. A highly flexible framework, considering that each part wherein has an opportunity to evolve, was developed. Following the principles of axiomatic design, the proposed framework was established. Ultimately, this research generates a range of detailed 3-hierarchical Icam DEFinitions for Function Modeling 0 (IDEF0) diagrams outlining the proposed nD BIM-IKBMS structure. This study identifies the interoperability of the proposed framework by standardizing communication protocols, data formats, naming convention, evaluation systems, and modulization. While this research is limited to implementing our nD BIM-IKBMS framework, real-world projects will be utilized in our upcoming steps of R&D series for validation purposes. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Uncertainty in the life cycle assessment of building emissions: A comparative case study of stochastic approaches
PY  - 2019
AU  - Zhang, X.
AU  - Zheng, R.

AB  - Life cycle assessment of buildings has become popular recently, due to the significant potential of emission reduction. Previous studies have contributed much to the quantification of emissions, yet the issue of uncertainties needs to be further investigated. In general, the uncertainty in life cycle assessment is mainly due to the errors in input parameters, definition of system boundary and scenario assumptions, and choice of analytical models, which could be summarized as parameter, scenario, and model uncertainties. In the present study, data quality indicators were adopted and a semi-quantitative method was modeled accordingly, relevant to the uncertainty analysis of building emission assessment. A case study building was analyzed comparing the deterministic and stochastic approaches, and the results indicate that the uncertainty in input parameters could result in a standard deviation of 3106 tCO2e for the sample mean of 61504 tCO2e, which is in line with the deterministic results. Further scenario analyses investigated the influence of scenario and modelling alternatives. Relevant results emphasized the definition of system boundary and energy efficiency to control uncertainties, and suggested applying statistical distribution for key parameters in analysis. Overall, the present study could provide useful information on the uncertainty of life cycle emission assessment, and, therefore, be helpful in decision-making regarding the low-carbon development of building industry. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Data center growth in the United States: Decoupling the demand for services from electricity use

AB  - Data centers are energy intensive buildings that have grown in size and number to meet the increasing demands of a digital economy. This paper presents a bottom-up model to estimate data center electricity demand in the United States over a 20 year period and examines observed and projected electricity use trends in the context of changing data center operations. Results indicate a rapidly increasing electricity demand at the turn of the century that has significantly subsided to a nearly steady annual electricity use of about 70 billion kWh in recent years. While data center workloads continue to grow exponentially, comparable increases in electricity demand have been avoided through the adoption of key energy efficiency measures and a shift towards large cloud-based service providers. Alternative projections from the model illustrate the wide range in potential electricity that could be consumed to support data centers, with the US data center workload demand estimated for 2020 requiring a total electricity use that varies by about 135 billion kWh, depending on the adoption rate of efficiency measures during this decade. While recent improvements in data center energy efficiency have been a success, the growth of data center electricity use beyond 2020 is uncertain, as modeled trends indicate that the efficiency measures of the past may not be enough for the data center workloads of the future. The results show that successful stabilization of data center electricity will require new innovations in data center efficiency to further decouple electricity demand from the ever-growing demand for data center services. © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - Building Simulation Software tools support designers to analyse and identify certain users’ behavioural patterns; besides, they can predict future trends about the energy demand and consumption in buildings, as well as CO2 emissions, design analysis, energy efficiency, or lighting. These tools allow to collect and report information about such processes. However, understanding the results from simulations usually implies interpreting an extremely large amount of data or graphs, which can be a complex task. Therefore, there is a need of alternatives that ease this interpretation of results, hence complementing classic simulation tools. Under the widespread EN 15251 model criteria, this paper presents a novel technology to improve reporting tools of building simulation software by using linguistic description of data and timespan computational perceptions. A data-driven software architecture for automatically generating linguistic reports is here proposed, which provides designers with a better understanding of the data from building simulation tools. In order to show and explore the possibilities of this technology, a software application has been designed, implemented and evaluated by experts. The survey showed that usefulness and clarification were better evaluated than simplicity and time-saving for the three kinds of report, though always above 7 points out of 10, being most of p-values of contingency below 0.05. © 2018, Tsinghua University Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Diaphragm action in floor structures is an important aspect that affects both local behaviors of individual members and consequently, the global response of a structure. The diaphragm action of a built structure, therefore needs to be compatible with the assumed diaphragm condition in the design phase to prevent unpredicted overloading of load bearing members in a seismic action. Autoclaved aerated concrete (AAC) is a cost-effective, lightweight and energy efficient material, and its usage as a construction material has rapidly increased in recent decades. However, there is a limited experience regarding the in-plane behavior of the floor structures made of AAC panels in terms of diaphragm action. In this paper, the in-plane response of AAC floors is experimentally investigated and the floor performance of a typical building is analytically investigated according to ASCE 7-16 (ASCE/SEI in Minimum design loads for buildings and other structures, The American Society of Civil Engineers, Reston, 2016). Full-scale experiments carried out through loading AAC floors in lateral directions to the panels, either parallel or perpendicular, provided important information about the damage progress and overall performance of such floors. A number of finite element modeling techniques that are generally used for modeling of AAC floors were examined and then validated through comparisons with test results. Finally, the diaphragm condition of a three-story building made of AAC walls and floor panels was assessed. The results indicated that the AAC floors in the examined building can be idealized as rigid diaphragms according to ASCE 7-16. © 2018, Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - This paper proposes a realistic demand side management mechanism in an urban district heating network (DHN) to improve system efficiency and manage congestion issues. Comprehensive models including the circulating pump, the distribution network, the building space heating (SH) and domestic hot water (DHW) demand were employed to support day-ahead hourly energy schedule optimization for district heating substations. Flexibility in both SH and DHW were fully exploited and the impacts of both weekly pattern and building type were modelled and identified in detail. The energy consumption scheduling problem was formulated for both the individual substations and the district heating operator. Three main features were considered in the formulation: user comfort, the heat market and network congestion. A case study was performed based on a representative urban DHN with a 3.5 MW peak thermal load including both residential and commercial buildings. Results show an up to 11% reduction of energy costs. A sensitivity analysis was conducted which provides decision makers with insights into how sensitive the optimum solution is to any changes in energy, user comfort or pumping costs. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Having access to real-time information on building occupants’ state of interactions enables optimization of building systems for improved energy efficiency, well-being and productivity of the occupants. In this paper, we propose a framework to learn occupant interactions from ambient sensing technologies (e.g., sensing of variables such as sound (dB), CO2 (ppm), light intensity (lux), dry-bulb temperature (°C), relative humidity (RH%), pressure (mbar)) from both stationary and wearable devices and select the technologies and averaging windows which contain the required information for learning. In this framework, several supervised machine learning algorithms are tested on the labeled datasets and the algorithm which outperforms others is selected. Two types of sensing devices were utilized for analyses: wearable devices worn around the neck by the test subjects, and a network of stationary devices located in the test subjects’ working indoor spaces. 221 employees of federal agencies housed in facilities managed by the US. General Services Administration in the mid-Atlantic and Southern states participated in this study, answering questions about their current task every hour. Overall accuracies were observed of 86.72% for wearable and stationary devices, 81.25% for only wearable-only, and 85.16% for stationary-only for prediction of the mixed multi-label classification via Random Forests algorithm. The high prediction allows for identifying subjects’ tasks when training labels are not available. Predicting occupants’ interactions as a main indicator of occupants’ behavior have significant implications for the energy efficiency of building systems (up to 20% savings). © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - New planning tools are required to depict the complete building stock in a city and investigate detailed measures on reaching local and global targets to improve energy efficiency and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. To pursue this objective, ISO (the International Organization for Standardization) 13790:2008 monthly heating and cooling energy calculation method is implemented using geometric information from 3D city models (e.g., CityGML format) in an open source software architecture. A model is developed and applied in several urban districts with different number of 3D buildings in various cities. The model is validated with the simulation software TRNSYS. We also perform a sensitivity analysis to quantify the impact of climate change and other physical and behavioral factors on modelling results. The proposed approach can help to perform city or district-wide analysis of the building energy needs and prepare different renovation plans to support decision-making, which finally will enhance the livability of a city and the quality of life of the citizens. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - Energy-efficient buildings assist in conserving energy and are currently prioritised due to increases in the cost of energy and greenhouse gas emissions. In this investigation, a low-thermal-conductivity walling material (bricks) was developed using co-fired blended ash (CFBA) for conserving energy in buildings. Physico-mechanical properties of the developed product were investigated according to Indian standards. Also, the thermal conductivity of the bricks was investigated. Building performance analysis was carried out with the help of a case study. Computational models for the single- (G), double- (G+1) and triple- (G+2) storeyed buildings were designed using the Autodesk Revit tool. The developed models were analysed for energy efficiency using building information modelling. With respect to fly ash bricks, the CFBA brick model estimated a 5% reduction in number of bricks as well as the dead load of the structure and resulted in peak cooling load reduction by 8, 11 and 15% for G, G+1 and G+2 storeyed buildings, respectively. © 2018 ICE Publishing: All rights reserved.

AB  - A data driven framework for the energy and comfort management in large buildings with multiple zones and dynamic occupancy patterns is presented in this paper. For such cases, precise heat conduction models derived using the classical thermal physics laws will be cumbersome. The approach uses the historical data to develop a multi-variable model through Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) so as to identify the relative dominance of the direct and indirect effects of thermal coupling among the neighboring zones, occupancy and the external climate variations on the thermal behavior of the building zones. Based on the information gathered from the SEM, we can predict the return temperatures more accurately, which in turn is employed to incorporate a flexible control strategy for the HVAC system. A controller fed with the temperature error and occupancy error, between the predicted and measured values, regulates the supply air fan speed via VFD motor and outside air damper valve openings. This has resulted in the energy savings while maintaining the occupant thermal comfort at the reasonable levels. The framework proposed has been evaluated using real data collected from an HVAC system of a big airport terminal building. The results show that the accuracy of prediction is relatively higher than with other regression techniques; and that the HVAC system is energy efficient and can ensure occupant comfort on real-time basis in large buildings. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to present a pedagogical practice in the project-based assessment of architectural, engineering and construction (AEC) students’ interdisciplinary building design work adopting BIM. This pedagogical practice emphasizes the impacts of BIM, as the digital collaboration platform, on the cross-disciplinary teamwork design through information sharing. This study also focuses on collecting students’ perceptions of building information modeling (BIM) effects in integrated project design. Challenges in BIM adoption from AEC students’ perspective were identified and discussed, and could spark further research needs. Design/methodology/approach: Based on a thorough review of previous pedagogical practices of applying BIM in multiple AEC disciplines, this study adopted a case study of the Solar Decathlon (SD) residential building design as the group project for AEC students to deliver the design work and construction planning. In total 13 different teams within the University of Nottingham Ningbo China, each group consisting of final year undergraduate students with backgrounds in architecture, civil engineering, and architectural environmental engineering, worked to deliver the detailed design of the solar-powered residential house meeting pre-specified project objectives in terms of architectural esthetics, structural integrity, energy efficiency, prefabrication construction techniques and other issues such as budget and scheduling. Each team presented the cross-disciplinary design plan with cost estimate and construction scheduling together within group reports. This pedagogical study collected students’ reflective thinking on how BIM affected their design work, and compared their feedback on BIM to that from AEC industry professionals in previous studies. Findings: The case study of the SD building project showed the capacity of BIM in enabling interdisciplinary collaboration through information exchange and in enhancing communication across different AEC fields. More sustainable design options were considered in the early architectural design stages through the cross-disciplinary cooperation between architecture and building services engineering. BIM motivated AEC student teams to have a more comprehensive design and construction plan by considering multiple criteria including energy efficiency, budget, and construction activities. Students’ reflections indicated both positive effects of BIM (e.g. facilitating information sharing) as well as challenges for further BIM implementation, for example, such as some architecture students’ resistance to BIM, and the lack of existing family types in the BIM library, etc. Research limitations/implications: Some limitations of the current BIM pedagogy were identified through the student group work. For example, students revealed the problem of interoperability between BIM (i.e. Autodesk Revit) and building energy simulation tools. To further integrate the university education and AEC industry practice, future BIM pedagogical work could recruit professionals and project stakeholders in the adopted case studies, for the purpose of providing professional advice on improving the constructability of the BIM-based design from student work. Practical implications: To further integrate the university education and AEC industry practice, future BIM pedagogical work could recruit professionals and project stakeholders in the adopted case study, for the purpose of providing professional advice in improving the constructability of the BIM-based design from student work. Originality/value: This work provides insights into the information technology applied in the AEC interdisciplinary pedagogy. Students gained the experience of a project-based collaboration and were equipped with BIM capabilities for future employment within the AEC job market. The integrated design approach was embedded throughout the team project process. Overall, this BIM pedagogical practice emphasized the link between academic activities and real-world industrial practice. The pedagogical experience gained in this BIM course could be expanded to future BIM education and research in other themes such as interoperability of building information exchange among different digital tools. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - The information (e.g., indoor air temperature and velocity distributions) of the non-uniform thermal environment is the base of the proper operation control of stratum ventilation for thermal comfort and energy efficiency. The current practice of modeling the non-uniform thermal environment requires inputs of the wall temperatures/heat fluxes, which increases the cost and complexity of the sensors because the building management system generally does not monitor the wall temperatures/heat fluxes. This study proposes to model the non-uniform thermal environment with the supply and exit air conditions as inputs. The supply and exit air conditions (i.e., the supply air temperature, supply airflow rate and exit air temperature) can be obtained readily from the building management system. Twenty-eight experiments of two stratum ventilated rooms with different geometries, heat source distributions and air terminal layouts have demonstrated that the proposed method can accurately predict the vertically and horizontally non-uniform distributions of the indoor air temperature and velocity, with root mean square errors (RMSEs) between 0.13 °C and 0.22 °C and between 0.008 m/s and 0.039 m/s respectively. For the dynamic control of stratum ventilation, the models of the indoor air temperatures from the experiments under steady states are found to apply to the dynamic variations of the indoor air temperatures from around 24 °C–30 °C, with RMSEs between 0.28 °C and 0.37 °C. The proposed method has also been experimentally validated to apply to displacement ventilation. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Motivated by a research project that studies the future of the energy system in rural areas at the border between Germany and the Czech Republic, and by the publication of the COSMO-REA high-resolution regional reanalysis data sets for Europe in 2017, this study presents a methodology for generating maps indicating minimum battery and photovoltaics sizes for self-sufficient single-family houses. The methodology consists of three subsequent parts: First, spatiotemporal data sets of electricity demand for single-family houses in rural and low-density urban areas are generated. Second, spatiotemporal data sets of photovoltaics potential are computed based on (a) a technical photovoltaics model, (b) two decades of hourly solar irradiance and temperature data, and (c) snow cover data from the Land Surface Analysis Satellite Applications Facility. Third, a linear optimization model serves to define photovoltaics and battery systems sizes and to generate the corresponding maps. The resulting maps cover Germany and the Czech Republic and are generated for 18 technical and weather-dependent scenarios. The results show how challenging it could be to achieve complete independence from the grid in certain locations. Especially relevant for the sizing of the systems are long periods (several days in a row) of low photovoltaic energy generation due to overcast sky conditions or snow cover of the panels. Furthermore, the results offer a scientifically based source of information for sizing photovoltaics and battery systems in the two countries. © 2018 The Authors

TI  - BIMification: How to create and use BIM for retrofitting
PY  - 2018
AU  - Scherer, R.J.
AU  - Katranuschkov, P.
AB  - Building Information Modeling (BIM) is rapidly advancing as an efficient new approach to cooperative building design and construction. However, BIM methodology is still mainly developed and applied for new building projects. The strong societal needs to improve the quality and the overall performance of the existing building stock, especially with regard to energy use, are yet insufficiently supported by BIM. In this paper we propose a structured approach towards the creation of a building information model of an existing building and its use for the purpose of retrofitting or renovation, based on the standard IFC specification (ISO 16739). It implies a process we define as BIMification. This process undergoes two major stages: (1) Anamnesis, dedicated to the survey and collection of facts about the building, and (2) Diagnosis, dedicated to the analysis and interpretation of the collected facts to obtain the necessary understanding of the building and its performance and prepare for the retrofitting design. The paper outlines the broader research aim that triggered the development of the suggested approach and presents the overall concept and methodology, the ICT platform under implementation and the current state of the work. Discussed are also the scope of the approach, envisaged perspectives and further development efforts. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Generic model-assisted control algorithms for building energy systems achieve an energy-efficient building operation while the implementation effort is lower than in the case of a taylor-made automation system. In this paper, a generic distributed simulation-model-assisted and exergy-based control algorithm is presented, which is applicable to typical building energy systems (BES). It exploits dynamic nonlinear simulation models from an open-source Modelica library and makes use of sequential neighbor communication. In the supply chains of a BES, the algorithm performs multiple optimizations of small subsystems by considering pre-defined values of pre-defined coupling variables. The objective function is the sum of the exergy destruction and loss, which is based only on measurements without additional information such as monetary costs. In a simulation case study, an open-loop and a closed-loop version of the algorithm are compared to a control system based on rules and feedback controllers that was optimized manually for this particular scenario to provide a benchmark. The tracking error of the closed-loop algorithm is close to the benchmark. The open-loop algorithm achieves an energy consumption close to the benchmark. These results show that the algorithm finds suitable solutions automatically whereas the rule-based control system cannot be expected to perform equally well if boundary conditions were changed. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AU  - Lee, D.-O.
AB  - As the era of the 4th Industrial Revolution IT convergence begins, there is high demand worldwide, for new innovation in a variety of areas to address the challenges of a dramatically changing IT convergence industry environment of construction. Specially, construction environment is changing rapidly. BIM (Building information modeling) technologies are used as a powerful tool in construction project for construction management and operation. The technologies are based on integrated management system of the whole construction process using 3D simulation, 4D (work management), 5D (cost management) and 7D (environment and energy). In this study, a model of 3D, 4D (work management), 5D (cost management) and 7D (environment and energy) based on the BIM during phases (pre-design, concept design, design development, construction documents and construction) is established aiming at building. A BIM process standardization of construction phase is suggested to review constructability and efficiency. © Rushing Water Publishers Ltd. 2018.

AB  - Air temperature modelling is a paramount task for practical applications such as agricultural production, designing energy-efficient buildings, harnessing of solar energy, health-risk assessments, and weather prediction. This paper entails the design and application of data-intelligent models for air temperature estimation without climate-based inputs, where only the geographic factors (i.e., latitude, longitude, altitude, &amp; periodicity or the monthly cycle) are used in the model design procedure performed for a large spatial study region of Madhya Pradesh, central India. The evaluated data-intelligent models considered are: generalized regression neural network (GRNN), multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS), random forest (RF), and extreme learning machines (ELM), where the forecasted results are cross-validated independently at 11 sparsely distributed sites. Observed and forecasted temperature is benchmarked with the coefficient of determination (R2), root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), Nash-Sutcliffe's coefficient (E), Legates &amp; McCabe's Index (LMI), and the spatially-represented temperature maps. In accordance with statistical metrics, the temperature forecasting accuracy of the GRNN model exceeds that of the MARS, RF and ELM models, as did the overall areal-averaged results for all tested sites. In terms of the global performance indicator (GPI; as a universal metric combining the expanded uncertainty, U95 and t-statistic at 95% confidence interval with conventional metrics, bias error, R2, RMSE) providing a complete assessment of the site-averaged results, the GRNN model yielded a GPI = 0.0181 vs. 0.0451, 0.1461 and 0.6736 for the MARS, RF and ELM models, respectively, which concurred with deductions made using U95 and t-statistic. Spatial maps for the cool winter, hot summer and monsoon seasons also confirmed the preciseness of the GRNN model, as did the 12-monthly average annual maps, and the inter-model evaluation of the most accurate and the least accurate sites using Taylor diagrams comparing the RMSE-centered difference and the correlations with observed data. In accordance with the results, the study ascertains that the GRNN model was a qualified data-intelligent tool for temperature estimation without a need for climate-based inputs, at least in the present investigation, and this model can be explored for its utility in energy management, building and construction, agriculture, heatwave studies, health and other socio-economic areas, particularly in data-sparse regions where only geographic and topographic factors are utilized for temperature forecasting. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The substantial measure of energy usage connected to the building atmosphere supports and sustains power usage modeling diligence. Amongst the numerous strategies to elaborate energy methods, supervised based machine learning approaches are immeasurable alternative to circumvent the inconvenience correlated to various engineering and data mining approaches when measured/observed data are accessible. This research depicts an analysis of electricity requirement forecasting by supervised based machine learning models with the limited data information. The power usage or energy consumption data is collected from power transmission and distribution networked organization independent system operator New England for one-year ahead energy forecasting. Moreover, energy consumption data is categorized into monthly, seasonally and yearly basis to foresee the performance for short-term, medium-term and long-term as well. Four-supervised based machine learning models employed for energy forecasting which are: i) Binary Decision Tree; ii) Compact Regression Gaussian Process; iii) Stepwise Gaussian Processes Regression; iv) Generalized Linear Regression Model. The input variables comprise the limited external environmental data, day-type/hour-type and the net energy consumption of various types of load. The output is the total energy demand of the building power usage. Modeling studies are escorted for expected energy demand in future perceptive based on Independent System Operator New England data. The performance evaluation indices applied in evaluating the model's forecasting error are coefficient of variation and mean absolute percentage error. In autumn season, the best MAPE and CV of the binary decision tree is 0.809% and 1.359% respectively for seasonal forecasting, and is 0.989% and 1.601% respectively for yearly forecasting. It is observed that the accuracy in forecasting is modest in the autumn season. In yearly prediction, the MAPE and CV of compact regression Gaussian process, stepwise Gaussian processes regression and generalized linear regression are 3.245% and 3.650%, 4.039% and 4.860%, 5.118% and 5.927% respectively. The machine learning model's performance compared and validated with the actual energy consumption, existing artificial neural network model and the mean absolute percentage error and coefficient of variation found 2.416% and 3.290% respectively for yearly prediction. It is depicted that including the utilization of limited energy usage and environmental data as one of the model's input variables, the electricity forecasting precision is more accurate, precise and can be improved. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Though distribution system operators have been adding more sensors to their networks, they still often lack an accurate real-time picture of the behavior of distributed energy resources such as demand responsive electric loads and residential solar generation. Such information could improve system reliability, economic efficiency, and environmental impact. Rather than installing additional costly sensing and communication infrastructure to obtain additional real-time information, it may be possible to use existing sensing capabilities and leverage knowledge about the system to reduce the need for new infrastructure. In this paper, we disaggregate a distribution feeder's demand measurements into: 1) the demand of a population of air conditioners, and 2) the demand of the remaining loads connected to the feeder. We use an online learning algorithm, Dynamic Fixed Share (DFS), that uses the real-time distribution feeder measurements as well as models generated from historical building- and device-level data. We develop two implementations of the algorithm and conduct case studies using real demand data from households and commercial buildings to investigate the effectiveness of the algorithm. The case studies demonstrate that DFS can effectively perform online disaggregation and the choice and construction of models included in the algorithm affects its accuracy, which is comparable to that of a set of Kalman filters. © 1969-2012 IEEE.

AB  - Cities and governments are increasingly interested in refurbishing the existing built environment as a key component in plans to reduce GHG emissions and resource efficiency strategies. In this sense, the building industry started to develop sustainability assessment tools, first to guide new or major renovation building projects, and slowly progressing toward the evaluation of neighborhoods and cities. However, scaling up sustainability is a challenge due to the increased number of parameters and stakeholders involved in the decision-making process. This paper presents a methodology to scale up LEED-ND sustainability assessment from the neighborhood towards the city scale with the support of GIS modeling. This approach was tested for the current Lisbon case study. It resulted in the identification of the priority intervention areas and parameters. The paper further highlights four policy recommendations: reduce water flood risk; increase mixed residential and non-residential developments; reinforce the adoption of energy certifications, and create similar schemes for water consumption. These findings can support decision-makers to develop urban redevelopment strategies and improve the overall city sustainability performance. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Eco-friendly materials have been developed recently that have made it possible to significantly reduce the maintenance cost of buildings when they are appropriately used in renovation. Indeed, it became extremely important to consider the eco-friendly energy-saving effects on design alternatives during renovation. The present study proposes a framework for the optimum maintenance decision-making model for considering eco-friendly energy to help people interested in making decisions concerning renovation; it requires that both the environmental friendliness and economic feasibility of the target building be simultaneously considered. Several studies mainly cover the structural aspects for energy improvements based on innovation and technology. However, energy simulation in existing buildings needs some additional consideration regarding the economic analysis of energy savings and the recovery period of construction costs. A case study was conducted as a research method by utilizing the proposed framework, which aims to: (1) make energy simulations with different basic design assumptions; (2) perform the energy simulations through building information modeling (BIM) technology; and (3) analyze the economic feasibility of the alternatives. As a result, an alternative combination that can save the net maximum energy cost during the life cycle period and invest the lowest renovation costs has been recommended. Furthermore, effective guidelines were proposed on which items the building owner values, depending on his economic investment conditions in decision-making regarding the level of design, through a comprehensive review of the energy savings by design variable. It is expected that the research findings will be utilized in the decision-making process and for conducting further relevant research in future. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - Due to the rapid rise of power consumption of data centers in recent years, much work has been done to develop energy-efficient design, controls and diagnosis of their cooling systems, while the energy system simulation is used as an effective tool. However, existing models of information technology (IT) equipment of data centers cannot well represent the effects of IT equipment design and operation status on the data center cooling demand, and this hinders the development of the energy saving cooling technologies of data centers. To address this issue, this paper introduces a power consumption model of IT equipment in data centers with coefficients and modeling script provided for immediate use in data center energy system simulation. This energy model can be used to simulate energy performance of typical IT equipment in data centers under real-time dynamic operation conditions conveniently and effectively without the need of data other than the specifications of a data center design and IT equipment manuals. Its use with a commonly used building simulation program is demonstrated with a building model of a typical large office in a subtropical area. The results show that the model can represent the change of power consumption of data centers with different IT equipment designs and operation appropriately. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Building energy simulations have found widespread use as decision-making tools for determining design and retrofitting actions. Despite their popularity, there exists a well-reported issue regarding the numerical treatment of structural thermal-storage components in these models. The optimal means of discretising multi-layer structures is complicated by the different thermo-physical properties, material configurations and boundary conditions encountered within building energy models. This paper addresses this information gap by proposing a methodology that can be universally applied to all multi-layer structures, ensuring accurate predictions while avoiding excessive computational cost. Governing dimensionless quantities of Biot and Fourier numbers are utilised within the discretisation process, making the methodology equally applicable to all materials. The presented methodology also accounts for the configuration of materials within multi-layer structures when assigning discretisation levels, leading to nodes being distributed in accordance with expected thermal gradients. The proposed discretisation methodology has been examined for a number of boundary conditions and wall types with excellent prediction accuracy achieved throughout. Additionally, the utility of resistance-only layers has been explored as a means of increasing computational efficiency. This highlighted the importance of considering both layer position and local thermal properties when simulating multi-layer structures. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - While technology advancements are improving the energy efficiency of buildings, occupant behavior remains a critical factor in ensuring the effectiveness of such enhancements. To this end, numerous eco-feedback systems have been developed to reduce building energy use through influencing occupants' behaviors during building operations. Information representation is a critical component in eco-feedback systems, affecting the users' interpretation, engagement, and motivation to reduce energy consumption. Many studies have focused on using different charts and technical units or abstract and artistic visualizations to represent energy consumption. However, the effectiveness of such techniques varies across studies. Recent research emphasizes the need to integrate information representation strategies that balance numeric and aesthetic appeal. Concurrently, studies have called for increased adoption of a Building Information Model (BIM) during a building's operations phase to improve facility management. In this paper, we introduce a new eco-feedback information representation method that combines numeric and aesthetic appeal through leveraging spatial and color-coding techniques in BIM. The BIM-integrated energy visualization approach developed in this paper uses the Revit Application Program Interface (API) and allows users to visualize and compare energy consumption values in 2D and 3D views of a multi-family building through a color-coding scheme in an as-built BIM. The method is validated through a user survey that quantitatively and qualitatively assesses the proposed 2D and 3D BIM eco-feedback compared to more traditional bar chart based eco-feedback. Our findings suggest that 2D spatial, color-coded eco-feedback provides the optimal information representation, as it is easy to understand, while evoking engaging and motivating responses from users. This study advances our understanding of eco-feedback information representation while expanding BIM applications during building operations. These are important steps to address the human dimension of energy efficiency in the built environment. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this paper an innovative small-scale concentrated solar 2 kWe organic Rankine cycle plant coupled with a phase change material storage tank equipped with reversible heat pipes is investigated using a simulation analysis. The plant, intended for residential applications, is going to be built and tested under the European funded H2020 Innova MicroSolar project executed by the consortium of several Universities and industrial organizations, led by Northumbria University. The authors of this work used the design of the integrated system, developed by the consortium, to preliminary estimate the overall performance of the system in order to provide useful information for its forthcoming real operation. In particular, according to the varying ambient conditions, the influence of different operation modes of the prototype plant are evaluated. The dynamic simulation analysis has shown an interesting performance of the system in terms of annual operating hours, power production and conversion efficiencies. More precisely, the organic Rankine cycle unit is able to operate for more than 3100 h/year, achieving the design performance when solar power is sufficiently high, producing about 5100 kWhe/year. For the considered operating set-point temperatures of the thermal energy storage, the plant is able to reach high conversion efficiency also when the organic Rankine cycle unit is supplied by discharging the energy stored in the storage tank, for about 800 h/year. Hence, the work has provided some useful insights into the best working conditions of such micro combined heat and power system to be integrated in residential buildings. Moreover, the analysis could serve as a general guide for the design and optimization of the mutual interactions of the different subsystems in small-scale concentrated solar organic Rankine cycle plants. © 2018 The Authors

TI  - An automated IFC-based workflow for building energy performance simulation with Modelica

AB  - Steadily increasing use of Building Information Modeling (BIM) in all phases of building's lifecycle, together with more attention for openBIM and growing software support for the most recent version of the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC 4) have created a very promising context for an even broader application of Building Energy Performance Simulation (BEPS). At the same time, an urgent need for modeling guidelines and standardization becomes evident. A well-defined BIM-based workflow and a set of tools that fully exploit and extend the possibilities of the openBIM-technology can make the difference when it comes to reliability and cost of BEPS to design, build and operate high-performance buildings. This paper describes the essential elements of this integrated workflow, explains why openBIM comprises much more than just a standardized file-format and what is achieved with the already available technology, namely the Information Delivery Manual (IDM) and a newly developed Model View Definition. This MVD is tailored to the needs of Building Energy Performance Simulation (BEPS) that uses the Modelica language together with a specific library (IDEAS) and can easily be adapted to other libraries. In this project, several tools have been developed to closely integrate BEPS and IFC4. The simulation engine now gets the vast majority of the required input directly from the IFC4-file. For the implementation of the tools, the PYTHON language and the open source library IfcOpenShell are used. A case study is presented, that was used for extensive tests of the proposed approach and the implemented tools. The essential benefits of this new workflow are illustrated, and the feasibility is demonstrated. Opportunities and remaining bottlenecks are identified to encourage further development of BIM software to fully support IFC4 as an information source for BEPS. Besides some improvements of the proprietary class structure and functionality, enabling the export of IFC4 files based on custom MVDs is one required key feature. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This study uses a fuzzy-based expert system to assess the impact of soil treatment (conventional tillage vs. no-till) and mineral nitrogen supply (0, 75, 150 kg N ha−1) on the energy performance and efficiency of sweet sorghum in the bioethanol supply chain. The different agronomic strategies were compared using four energy indicators: energy yield, net energy gain, energy use efficiency and energy return on energy invested. The highest productivity in bioethanol and energy yield required the full energy input management, while conventional tillage without N fertilization resulted in the best agronomic strategy in terms of net energy gain. The highest energy use efficiency was achieved from the lowest-agro-energy-input cropping system (no-till without nitrogen fertilization). Uncertainty and vague information resulted from the investigation of multiple different metrics. As a consequence, aggregating information into a single multi-composite indicator can be useful. The multi-metric indicator based on the fuzzy-based expert system clearly indicated the behavior of a cropping system in optimizing the energy performance and efficiency of the sweet sorghum-bioethanol chain in a specific pedo-climatic context. The optimization between energy input and output was achieved by the agronomic strategy that combined conventional tillage without nitrogen fertilization, while no-till with 75 kg N ha−1 was inefficient. The proposed method is flexible in building a synthetic index to assess the sustainability of biomass production for energy purposes. An operative module for evaluating the energy performance and energy use efficiency of a cropping system through a multi-composite metric is also provided in this paper. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Occupancy-driven energy-efficient buildings using audio processing with background sound cancellation
PY  - 2018
AU  - Huang, Q.
AB  - Demand-driven HVAC (heating, ventilation, and air conditioning) operation is essential in occupant-oriented smart buildings, where the levels of heating, cooling, and ventilation are intelligently regulated to avoid energy waste. Despite the great potential of building energy efficiency, one of the remaining technical challenges is how to accurately estimate building occupancy information in real time. In this paper, this design challenge is addressed. An advanced audio-processing technique is adopted that minimizes the impacts of environmental sounds on the recorded voice sounds of humans. Adopted mathematical modeling and signal processing procedures are elaborated in this work. Experimental studies show that our proposed audio processing with background sound cancellation algorithm improves the estimation accuracy of room occupancy quantity by approximately 11-12%, which results in an averaged ventilation energy reduction of 3.54% compared to the case of not applying background sound cancellation. The proposed audio-processing technique is promising to achieve non-intrusive, cost-effective, robust, and accurate solutions for building occupancy estimation. © 2018 by the authors.

TI  - Probabilistic assessment of the potential indoor air impacts of vent-free gas heating appliances in energy-efficient homes in the United States
PY  - 2018
AU  - Whitmyre, G.K.
AU  - Pandian, M.D.
AB  - Use of vent-free gas heating appliances for supplemental heating in U.S. homes is increasing. However, there is currently a lack of information on the potential impact of these appliances on indoor air quality for homes constructed according to energy-efficient and green building standards. A probabilistic analysis was conducted to estimate the impact of vent-free gas heating appliances on indoor air concentrations of carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), carbon dioxide (CO2), water vapor, and oxygen in “tight” energy-efficient homes in the United States. A total of 20,000 simulations were conducted for each Department of Energy (DOE) heating region to capture a wide range of home sizes, appliance features, and conditions, by varying a number of parameters, e.g., room volume, house volume, outdoor humidity, air exchange rates, appliance input rates (Btu/hr), and house heat loss factors. Predicted airborne levels of CO were below the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) standard of 9 ppm for all modeled cases. The airborne concentrations of NO2 were below the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) guideline of 0.3 ppm and the Health Canada benchmark of 0.25 ppm in all cases and were below the World Health Organization (WHO) standard of 0.11 ppm in 99–100% of all cases. Predicted levels of CO2 were below the Health Canada standard of 3500 ppm for all simulated cases. Oxygen levels in the room of vent-free heating appliance use were not significantly reduced. The great majority of cases in all DOE regions were associated with relative humidity (RH) levels from all indoor water vapor sources that were less than the EPA-recommended 70% RH maximum to avoid active mold and mildew growth. The conclusion of this investigation is that when installed in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions, vent-free gas heating appliances maintain acceptable indoor air quality in tight energy-efficient homes, as defined by the standards referenced in this report. Implications: Probabilistic modeling of indoor air concentrations of carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), carbon dioxide (CO2), water vapor, and oxygen associated with use of vent-free gas heating appliances provides new data indicating that uses of these devices are consistent with acceptable indoor air quality in “tight” energy-efficient homes in the United States. This study will provide authoritative bodies such as the International Code Council with definitive information that will assist in the development of future versions of national building codes, and will provide evaluation of the performance of unvented gas heating products in energy conservation homes. © 2018 A&WMA.

AB  - A novel dynamic model for the temperature inside buildings is presented, aiming to improve energy efficiency by providing predictive information on the heat demand. To analyse the performance and generalizability of the modelling approach, real measurement data was gathered from five different types of buildings. Easily available data from various sources was utilized. The chosen model structure leads to a minimal number of input variables and free parameters. Simulations with real data from five buildings, and applying the identical model structure showed that the average modelling error during the 28-h prediction horizon was constantly below 5%. The results thus demonstrate that the model structure can be standardized and easily applied to predict the indoor temperatures of large buildings. This would finally enable demand side management and the predictive optimization of the heat demand at city level. © 2018 by the authors.

TI  - Modeling occupancy distribution in large spaces with multi-feature classification algorithm
PY  - 2018
AU  - Wang, W.
AU  - Chen, J.
AU  - Hong, T.
AB  - Occupancy information enables robust and flexible control of heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems in buildings. In large spaces, multiple HVAC terminals are typically installed to provide cooperative services for different thermal zones, and the occupancy information determines the cooperation among terminals. However, a person count at room-level does not adequately optimize HVAC system operation due to the movement of occupants within the room that creates uneven load distribution. Without accurate knowledge of the occupants’ spatial distribution, the uneven distribution of occupants often results in under-cooling/heating or over-cooling/heating in some thermal zones. Therefore, the lack of high-resolution occupancy distribution is often perceived as a bottleneck for future improvements to HVAC operation efficiency. To fill this gap, this study proposes a multi-feature k-Nearest-Neighbors (k-NN) classification algorithm to extract occupancy distribution through reliable, low-cost Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) networks. An on-site experiment was conducted in a typical office of an institutional building to demonstrate the proposed methods, and the experiment outcomes of three case studies were examined to validate detection accuracy. One method based on City Block Distance (CBD) was used to measure the distance between detected occupancy distribution and ground truth and assess the results of occupancy distribution. The results show the accuracy when CBD = 1 is over 71.4% and the accuracy when CBD = 2 can reach up to 92.9%. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The use of building information modeling (BIM) to create a building energy model (BEM) compared with traditional simulation practices offers significant timesaving potentials by minimizing efficiency issues, legal disputes, added costs, and delays. The BIM-BEM strategy avoids remodeling the building to create the BEM by exchanging architectural information to complete the energy analysis. However, most existing frameworks do not simultaneously describe the BIM-BEM process and related technical aspects to be followed during the design process. Therefore, this paper proposes a comprehensive BIM-BEM framework initially created based on theoretical and field investigations and then enhanced by a trial investigation using a testing case. The proposed framework is illustrated in an easy-to-follow process map that includes work/data flows and specifies data exchangers and information requirements. The framework is validated using a complex case study to demonstrate its applicability for different BEM tools. The proposed framework intends to provide the industry with a useful and generic process for BIM-BEM that enables professionals to create proper BIM and BEM to complete energy analysis during the design process. © 2018 American Society of Civil Engineers.

TI  - Low-energy design strategies for retrofitting existing residential buildings in Cyprus
PY  - 2018
AU  - Ozarisoy, B.
AU  - Altan, H.
AB  - Problems on mass housing estates are currently a topic for research on energy and policy interventions in Cyprus. Modernist urban detached/semi-detached and suburban row houses often have insufficient green areas and lack consideration of the climatic features of the building site where the neighbourhoods are designed without concern for urban planning laws and regulations. These purpose-built residential building stock models represent 30% of the existing building stock. This research primarily investigates the potential of particular design interventions in detached two-storey houses in a Mediterranean climate in order to reduce the need for fossil fuel to heat and cool the houses. The aim of this study is to develop and test feasible retrofit strategies aimed at optimising the energy performance of the existing residential buildings. To accomplish this, the study first examines the energy performance of a building before and after the retrofitting phases as base case scenario models. The Autodesk Revit 2017 plug-in Green Building Studio energy performance analysis software was used for simulation of the adapted energy-efficient retrofit measures. This study also outlines the results from the prototype analysis to demonstrate the difference between a retrofitted building and the existing state of a building in their respective energy use impacts. © 2019 ICE Publishing: All rights reserved.

PY  - 2018
AU  - Natephra, W.

AU  - Fukuda, T.
AB  - The thermal performance of building envelopes has a profound effect on maintaining indoor environmental conditions and is critical in obtaining an energy-efficient design. Choosing appropriate building envelope materials is one of the most effective ways to manage heat flows, prevent excessive building energy consumption, and maintain a comfortable temperature for occupants. The OTTV standards are popularly used worldwide for assessing the rate of heat transfer through building envelopes. However, manual calculation methods for OTTV are involved functions with various variables and coefficients that need to be considered. Furthermore, computing multiple functions using manual calculation method can be time-consuming and human error can be occurred throughout the completion of the calculation process. Accessing materials’ thermal properties from BIM potentially reduce the time required to derive coefficients for the OTTV measurement. Therefore, this research presents a BIM-based approach to provide an automatic assessment of the OTTVs of building envelopes. This study proposes integrating BIM and a developed visual scripting to automatically extract thermal and physical properties from the BIM database for supporting thermal transfer value calculation. The applicability of the proposed system is validated in a BIM model of an office building. The proposed system provides a valuable decision support system for designers to select an appropriate envelope material to achieve an optimum OTTV for optimizing energy-efficient building design. This study proposes integrating BIM and a developed visual scripting to automatically extract thermal and physical properties from the BIM database, and provide a real-time thermal transfer value calculation. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Buildings subject to Energy Performance Contracts (EPCs) are usually quite complex public buildings, sometimes relatively old and usually barely documented from the technical standpoint. Gathering comprehensive and reliable technical information is a time consuming and expensive process that has to be carried out within the submission deadline. In these conditions, the standard approach to energy performance forecasting which uses detailed simulation is practically unfeasible. This paper proposes a reduced-order modeling approach that is tailored to the EPC tendering phase. The proposed methodology extends a third order building model, introducing explicit, albeit still abstract, representations of the heating/cooling system, of the weather influence and of the end-user gains. The extended parameter set reflects to a large degree the information that is readily available in practical on-site surveying, or that can be easily calculated from that information. As a consequence of the simplified physics, a knowledge driven, practical calibration procedure, which provides an effective way of reducing uncertainty, is proposed. The calibration procedure analyses the uncertainty present in the available knowledge and uses the constraints imposed by the implemented physics on the parameters’ dynamic to assess their value estimation. The modeling approach is exemplified through three case studies: the first one provides the comparison of the reduced-order model predictions with the outcomes of a detailed model of a small hospital, the second one is used to compare the reduced-order model predictions with the detailed measurements of energy consumption of a real building, and the third case study exemplifies the use in operational context with scarce information. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Prefabricated construction is believed to be energy conserving though opportunities for achieving higher energy efficiency have yet to be fully harnessed. From investigation of a prefabricated construction project in Hong Kong, two main problems have been revealed relating to energy consumption, including: (i) inefficient management of resources such as labours and machines, and (ii) inefficient production, transportation, and on-site assembly of prefabricated components. These problems are primarily caused by lagged information communication and human errors. This paper seeks to offer a solution by developing a Physical Internet-enabled Building Information Modelling System (PI-BIMS) that integrates Auto-ID technologies, BIM, and cloud computing. The PI-BIMS enables real-time collection, communication, and visualisation of information across the processes of production, transportation, and on-site assembly. Practical issues of the system implementation are provided through a pilot prototype. It is found that the PI-BIMS helps enhance the resource allocation efficiency and decrease human errors. Thus, an alternative opportunity to improve energy efficiency in prefabricated construction has become possible. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - The paper presents the residential sector building typology, thermal energy balance, and scenarios prepared at several levels of sector segmentation to assist the design of low-carbon development policies for Albania, Serbia, and Montenegro. The research is breakthrough for developing Europe and could be replicated in its countries. The paper describes methodological steps and selected results. First, representative building types were identified; their energy performances by end-use, retrofit packages, as well as associated costs were assessed. Second, this information was inserted into a bottom-up simulation model prepared in the Long-range Energy Alternatives Planning System (LEAP) software. Using it, sector energy balances, the reference scenario, as well as moderate and advanced low-carbon high-thermal-comfort scenarios were prepared. The low-carbon scenarios assumed ambitious regulatory and financial policies. It was found that due to fuel poverty partial and intermittent heating is a typical situation; therefore, the thermal demand as predicted by the models applied to the different segments of the dwelling stock is much higher than its actual consumption. Also, actual consumption by energy source was found not fitting official energy balances because households use more wood and more heating systems than officially reported. In 2030, the moderate and ambitious scenarios lead to a reduction of CO2 emissions by 23–73% and 16–73% respectively versus the reference, offering however at the same time higher thermal comfort. The priority is to retrofit small buildings constructed after 1991 in Albania and those built in 1971–1990 in Montenegro and Serbia. Assuming the discount rate of 4% and counting saved energy costs as benefits, almost all scenarios are cost-effective as a whole on the country level, however not for many building categories. Therefore, not only saved energy costs but also other benefits should be monetized and compared to the scenario costs that present the next research opportunity. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.

AB  - To avoid expanding existing fossil power plants, building the energy performance management system is an effect method to cope with a high growth demand of electricity in China's urbanization process. The accuracy thermal load prediction is the first step to build an energy performance management system which has important significance for energy saving, decreasing air pollution and high-efficiency operation of HVAC system. This paper discusses the use of hybrid intelligent approaches and re-optimization strategy, a multi-layer hybrid model (APNN) has been proposed by hybridizing an auto-regressive model with exogenous inputs (ARX) and a particle swarm optimization neural network (PSO-NN) to make a good use of the comprehensive information of the meteorological data and historical data. For the purposes of improving prediction precision generalization ability of the multi-layer hybrid model, temperature interval and hierarchical modeling techniques were used. According to the re-optimization strategy, there are two improvements of the previous proposed APNN model, which are based on temperature interval and hierarchical modeling by solar radiation intensity. Compared with the basic prediction models, validation results show that accuracy of the optimized models are greatly improved. What's more, the optimization of multi-layer hybrid building's cooling and heating load soft sensing technology enhance learning and generalization capability of the basic APNN model. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This study aims to develop prediction models for HVAC related energy saving in office buildings. The data-driven modelling makes use of data gathered from several energy audit reports. These reports entail building and energy consumption data for 56 office buildings in Singapore. The two models are developed using Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN). The methodology to select the most appropriate input variables forms the essence of this study. This variable selection procedure involves 819,150 iterations, taking all possible combinations of the 14 input variables to determine the most accurate model. The dependent variable is taken as the change in energy use intensity (EUI, measured in kWh/m2.year) between pre- and post-retrofit conditions. The results show that the ANN model is more accurate with a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 14.8%. The best combination of variables to achieve this comprises of gross floor area (GFA), air-conditioning energy consumption, operational hours and chiller plant efficiency. The information on these four variables, along with the prediction model can be used to predict HVAC related energy savings in office buildings to be retrofitted. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AU  - Marinakis, V.
AU  - Doukas, H.
AB  - The energy sector is closely interconnected with the building sector and integrated Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) solutions for effective energy management supporting decision-making at building, district and city level are key fundamental elements for making a city Smart. The available systems are designed and intended exclusively for a predefined number of cases and systems without allowing for expansion and interoperability with other applications that is partially due to the lack of semantics. This paper presents an advanced Internet of Things (IoT) based system for intelligent energy management in buildings. A semantic framework is introduced aiming at the unified and standardised modelling of the entities that constitute the building environment. Suitable rules are formed, aiming at the intelligent energy management and the general modus operandi of Smart Building. In this context, an IoT-based system was implemented, which enhances the interactivity of the buildings’ energy management systems. The results from its pilot application are presented and discussed. The proposed system extends existing approaches and integrates cross-domain data, such as the building’s data (e.g., energy management systems), energy production, energy prices, weather data and end-users’ behaviour, in order to produce daily and weekly action plans for the energy end-users with actionable personalised information. © 2018 by the authors.

TI  - Predicting electricity consumption for commercial and residential buildings using deep recurrent neural networks

AU  - Rahman, A.

AB  - This paper presents a recurrent neural network model to make medium-to-long term predictions, i.e. time horizon of ⩾1 week, of electricity consumption profiles in commercial and residential buildings at one-hour resolution. Residential and commercial buildings are responsible for a significant fraction of the overall energy consumption in the U.S. With advances in sensors and smart technologies, there is a need for medium to long-term prediction of electricity consumption in residential and commercial buildings at hourly intervals to support decision making pertaining to operations, demand response strategies, and installation of distributed generation systems. The modeler may have limited access to information about building's schedules and equipment, making data-driven machine learning models attractive. The energy consumption data that is available may also contain blocks of missing data, making time-series predictions difficult. Thus, the main objectives of this paper are: (a) Develop and optimize novel deep recurrent neural network (RNN) models aimed at medium to long term electric load prediction at one-hour resolution; (b) Analyze the relative performance of the model for different types of electricity consumption patterns; and (c) Use the deep NN to perform imputation on an electricity consumption dataset containing segments of missing values. The proposed models were used to predict hourly electricity consumption for the Public Safety Building in Salt Lake City, Utah, and for aggregated hourly electricity consumption in residential buildings in Austin, Texas. For predicting the commercial building's load profiles, the proposed RNN sequence-to-sequence models generally correspond to lower relative error when compared with the conventional multi-layered perceptron neural network. For predicting aggregate electricity consumption in residential buildings, the proposed model generally does not provide gains in accuracy compared to the multi-layered perceptron model. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Linking BIM and Design of Experiments to balance architectural and technical design factors for energy performance
PY  - 2018
AU  - Schlueter, A.
AU  - Geyer, P.
AB  - To transform the existing energy systems towards renewable energy sources, buildings need to use less energy, use energy more efficiently and harness local renewable energy sources. For the design of energy-efficient buildings, building energy simulation of varying sophistication is commonly employed. Types of simulations range from simple, static calculations to sophisticated dynamic simulation. Especially for building retrofit many assumptions on construction, material etc. have to be taken, which increases the uncertainty of simulation results. In conjunction with simulation, methods of Building Performance Optimization are increasingly employed. They are able to identify best performing designs however do not provide insights on the mechanisms and interdependencies of the different design factors, which are most valuable to make informed design decisions. We present a methodology that aims to provide a better understanding and create knowledge about the influence and interactions of different architectural and technical design factors on building energy performance of a specific design task. For this purpose, we introduce Design of Experiments (DoE) in an integrated design workflow using the Design Performance Viewer (DPV) toolset, combining Building Information Modeling (BIM), distributed dynamic simulation and statistical analysis of the extensive simulation results. The experiments created using the methodology allow to identify the strength of effects and interactions of different design factors on selected performance indicators. We apply the methodology on an office retrofit case, introducing a factor scatterplot for result visualization, development and comparison of retrofit strategies. We further evaluate its potential to identify high performing strategies while balancing architectural and technical factors and their impact on energy performance. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Energy consumption modelling at the urban scale is crucial for supporting a transition towards the low-carbon city. Unfortunately, there are not many robust examples or standardised approaches available in the literature for delivering effective low-carbon urban energy planning. In particular, there is a lack of appropriate frameworks or systems which allow an effective and reliable assessment of energy use in the built environment at district-urban scale. This paper illustrates the development of a geospatial bottom-up statistical model to estimate the energy consumption of a large number of residential building stocks for heating space, considering a wide range of variables. The proposed methodology is based on a 2D/3D- Geographic Information System (GIS) and Multiple Linear Regression (MLR), which provides location-based information for each single dwelling to identify correlations and assess the demand-side consumption at the urban scale. This framework was tested on a medium-sized Italian city, including around 3600 residential buildings. The results provided by the model are validated using residual analysis and cross-validation. Moreover, the spatial results provided by this study represent a useful tool to aid decision-makers in the urban planning process. These results can help to create future energy transition strategies, implementing energy efficiency and renewable energy technologies in the context of sustainable cities. This work is part of a national Smart City & Communities project, named “EEB- Zero Energy Buildings in Smart Urban Districts” nonetheless, the methodology illustrated in this paper can be generalised and applied to other European urban contexts. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Automation in Civil Engineering design is no longer unfamiliar anymore in the construction industry. It brings great efficiency gains and has reduced many of the complicated aspects of design. Automation has been developing since over the last four decades where advancement of computer hardware and in line with software developments has enabled various sort of design to be computerized. The design process is now more fast and accurate, and the entire process has been outstandingly improved by the available technology. However, the problems related to computerized design, started from the possibilities for unrecognized or unanticipated consequences as the design becomes more complicated. In line with it is the global warming issue that has been threatening the human being. Therefore, this paper reviews the design automation and its application in civil engineering design emphasizing in assessing the energy efficiency of buildings, which includes background information, its application, advantages, and challenges and also suggestions to further improve the automation in civil engineering design by artificial intelligence (AI). It was discovered that since over the past few years, BIM implementation in Civil Engineering design has started to be adopted massively in construction industry due to its tremendous advantages. In this paper, a new flow process in design automation in assessing building sustainability has been proposed by implementing AI BIM which is linked with MyCREST, a green rating tool in Malaysia in order to assist designers to conceptually design for a more energy efficient building. © 2018 Authors.

AB  - Knowledge of buildings0 energy efficiency has advanced thanks to research carried out in recent years. Many of the discoveries in this field have recently been incorporated into mandatory construction regulations for each country. However, not many of the architects and engineers involved in the construction industry clearly know how to achieve those goals in their designs. This document is based on the extensive experience in architectural design, the integration of renewable energies, the energy simulation of buildings and data acquisition, and analysis of the research team involved. It is presented in a practical and holistic approach and focused in subtropical climates. A structured methodology for the proper decision-making process during all the different stages of a minimum energy building (MEB) is likewise presented. The proposed methodology depicted aims at providing architects and engineers with a systematic and orderly step-by-step procedure and incorporates the instrumentation/control and data analysis as essential elements that support the validation of the expected results from the design, the construction, and the operation phase of the building. The paper develops a case study that illustrates the proposed methodology. This new methodology for MEB in subtropical climates constitutes an innovation in this field. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - Heating, cooling and domestic hot water (DHW) are responsible for the largest share of energy use in residential buildings in Spain and play an important role in the implementation of nearly zero-energy buildings (NZEB). Building Information Modelling (BIM) is expected to promote more efficient buildings through evaluation of different design options. BIM can be used as a platform from which to gather information that can be conveyed to energy efficiency simulation tools. The objective of this paper was to implement the model of a reversible air-to-water heat pump in EnergyPlus 8.9. This model was employed to analyze the performance of an aerothermal heat pump system (B) in a residential building under different Spanish climates compared to a conventional Heating, Ventilating and Air Conditioning (HVAC) system (A). Significant primary energy savings were achieved with system B compared to system A. These energy savings were higher in climates with a significant heating demand such as Madrid (27.4%) and Burgos (33.6%), and in cities with a mild climate such as Barcelona (37%). The residential building studied in this work was classified as Class A according to the CO2 emissions scale when using the aerothermal heat pump system, and as Class B when using the conventional HVAC system. © 2018 by the authors.

AU  - Nikolic, J.
AB  - Post-war industrialized housing between 1955 and 1985 in Belgrade and its special form of integrated prefabrication has been analyzed with a strong interest in transformation capacity of industrialized building model (IBM) on different technical levels. Research field is massive housing up to 23 floors, 400 dwellings per building and different housing layouts- to be evaluated for potential retrofitting at the dwelling level. IBM for massive housing built with IMS construction technology represents an integration of systems' components into hierarchy assemblies by simple joints. IMS Building Technology by IMS Institute is the system for high-rise structures with prefabricated elements of the skeleton. In order to assess the current situation regarding the selection and implementation of energy savings measures and the role of industrialized technology in supporting the rehabilitation of post-war housing in Belgrade-building configuration model and IMS construction technology has been analyzed, providing in-depth information on the way building components and systems are put together into IBM. In which way retrofit may be approached? IBM is represented with graph model (GM) diagram to describe a number of value-added processes according to independent systems/components and flexible connections. This paper highlights the technological aspects of "open" prefabrication industry and building with the systems that should be assessed in the future retrofitting of massive housing based on industrialization and energy efficiency. The paper proposes an IBM that provides concrete description of massive housing buildings, the requirements for information to be provided to approving refurbishment processes. The research also addresses both: challenges as well as opportunities for advancing Building Information Modeling (BIM) standards in off-site re-construction of massive housing with new "infill" industry. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - To apply the BIM technology to the construction domain, it is necessary to prepare the environment before the development of the applied technology. This study focuses on the requirements for applying the BIM technology to the energy domain in various construction domains. The purpose of this study is to suggest the core element technology based on the BIM data interoperability among the requirements for the BIM-based energy performance analysis. To achieve this purpose, the authors have investigated the advantage of the BIM-based energy performance analysis through a comparison with the traditional energy performance analysis and suggested requirements for energy performance analysis in the open BIM environment. In addition, the authors have suggested a configuration plan of the core element technology to improve the BIM data interoperability. Architects can use the existing data to find the best design alternative that optimizes the building energy efficiency without extra modeling work for the energy analysis using the suggested BIM technology in this study. © 2018 SERSC Australia.

AB  - Design choices with a unilateral focus on the reduction of operational energy for developing energy-efficient and near-zero energy building practices can increase the impact of the embodied energy, as there is a trade-off between embodied and operational energy. Multi-objective optimization approaches enable exploration of the trade-off problems to find sustainable design strategies, but there has been limited research in applying it to find optimal design solution(s) considering the embodied versus operational energy trade-off. Additionally, integration of this approach into a Building Information Modeling (BIM) for facilitating set up of the building model toward optimization and utilizing the benefits of BIM for sharing information in an interoperable and reusable manner, has been mostly overlooked. To address these issues, this paper presents a framework that supports the making of appropriate design decisions by solving the trade-off problem between embodied and operational energy through the integration of a multi-objective optimization approach with a BIM-driven design process. The applicability of the framework was tested by developing a prototype and using it in a case study of a low energy dwelling in Sweden, which showed the potential for reducing the building's Life Cycle Energy (LCE) use by accounting for the embodied versus operational energy trade-off to find optimal design solution(s). In general, the results of the case study demonstrated that in a low energy dwelling, depending on the site location, small reductions in operational energy (i.e. 140 GJ) could result in larger increases in embodied energy (i.e. 340 GJ) and the optimization process could yield up to 108 GJ of LCE savings relative to the initial design. This energy saving was equivalent to up to 8 years of the initial design's operational energy use for the dwelling, excluding household electricity use. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Interoperability in BIM is low and the focus is on 3D coordination. Despite the available standards including IFC and IDM, there is still no clear guidance how such standards can be effectively used for performance based design. Thus, early collaboration is discouraged and performance analysis is conducted as late as possible to minimize the number of information exchanges, leading to difficulties and costly changes in design that is almost completed. Aim is to propose an interoperability specification development approach for performance based design through the Design4Energy case study project. Findings show that the design process had increased flexibility, shared understanding between stakeholders about what information nuggets should be provided from whom to whom, at what stage, using which tool and data model. It can guide for the integrated BIM practice and help developing BIM execution plans for Level 2 BIM while paving the way for Level 3 BIM. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Urban energy modelling requires a large amount of detailed data to perform systematic dynamic simulations of a large number of buildings, where the adoption of energy efficiency strategies is an important concern for sustainable urban planning. National statistical datasets collect important aggregated data regarding building construction, energy consumption and occupants, and cities are making a significant effort to update spatial referenced data of their territory. However, these data is generally not detailed enough, being available at different scales and in different formats. The integrated use of these data is critical to validate different methods to predict and model energy consumption in cities, as well in addressing its energy saving potential. Furthermore, scenario analysis for retrofit or new design is only possible at building scale, highlighting the potential of a bottom-up database. This paper presents the process of collecting, mapping, cleansing and integrating urban data resulting in an UBD to support an information system for Smart Cities. The goal is to reduce the gap between the available urban data and the specific data required to run a complete urban building energy simulation. Key characteristics of an UBD are explored and applied to a case study in Lisbon, Portugal. As a result, a Buildings Dashboard is developed, materializing the UBD user interface. This dashboard allows the interactive visualization and data exploration of the building stock at multiple scales. Future work includes the development of an Urban Scenario category, bringing new insights on urban energy simulation and scenario evaluation to this platform. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Building heat demand is responsible for a significant share of the total global final energy consumption. Building stock models with a high spatio-temporal resolution are a powerful tool to investigate the effects of new building policies aimed at increasing energy efficiency, the introduction of new heating technologies or the integration of buildings within an energy system based on renewable energy sources. Therefore, building stock models have to be able to model the improvements and variation of used materials in buildings. In this paper, we propose a method based on generalized large-scale geographic information system (GIS) to model building heat demand of large regions with a high temporal resolution. In contrast to existing building stock models, our approach allows to derive the envelope of all buildings from digital elevation models and to model location dependent effects such as shadowing due to the topography and climate conditions. We integrate spatio-temporal climate data for temperature and solar radiation to model climate effects of complex terrain. The model is validated against a database containing the measured energy demand of 1845 buildings of the city of St. Gallen, Switzerland and 120 buildings of the Alpine village of Zernez, Switzerland. The proposed model is able to assess and investigate large regions by using spatial data describing natural and anthropogenic land features. The validation resulted in an average goodness of fit (R2) of 0.6. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Decomposing core energy factor structure of U.S. commercial buildings through clustering around latent variables with Random Forest on large-scale mixed data
PY  - 2017
AU  - Wang, E.
AB  - Accurate selection of explanatory factors is critical for precise quantitative energy analysis (e.g. benchmarking and predicting) to support the sustainability strategy in commercial building sector. Nevertheless, the generic guiding information on factor selection lacks. This paper addresses the research gap to decompose building energy factor structure (i.e. the interaction structure among the factors which affect building energy performance) particularly at a nation level for factor selection. Specifically, an iterative approach is developed by integrating the technical strengths of Variable Clustering and Random Forest to remove collinearity, redundancy and nonrelevance. Based on a comprehensive source database extracted from a multiframe country-wide survey, the core energy factor space is revealed for 2779 commercial buildings in the U.S. In particular, 36 principal factors are identified to reliably explain building energy efficiency variations. These factors are of sufficient independence and heterogeneity which may benefit the development of parsimonious energy modeling frameworks. The robustness of the deciphered factor structure and the representativeness of the recognized critical factors are numerically validated. These acquired results can be useful for informed decision analysis and rational policy design in commercial building sector with a lighter data burden. © 2017

AB  - To achieve computational efficiency, efforts toward developing urban-scale energy modeling applications frequently rely on various domain simplifications. For instance, heat transfer phenomena are captured using reduced order models. As a consequence, specific aspects pertaining to the temporal dynamics of energy load patterns and their dependency on transient phenomena (e.g., weather conditions, inhabitants’ presence and actions) cannot be realistically represented. To address this circumstance, we have conceived, implemented, and documented a two-step urban energy modeling approach that combines cluster analysis and sampling techniques, full dynamic numeric simulation capability, and stochastic methods. The paper describes the suggested urban energy modeling approach and the embedded cluster analysis supported sampling methodology. More particularly we focus on the aspects of this approach that explicitly involve the representation of inhabitants in urban-scale energy modeling. In this regard, the potential to recover lost dynamic diversity (e.g., in computation of temporal load patterns) due to the deployed reductive sampling is explored. Parametric runs based on stochastic variations of underlying building use profiles facilitate the generation of highly realistic load patterns despite the small number of buildings selected to represent the simulation domain. We illustrate the utility of the proposed urban energy modeling approach to address queries concerning the energy efficiency potential of behaviorally effective instruments. The feasibility of the envisioned scenarios concerning inhabitants and their behavior (high-resolution temporal load prediction, assessment of behavioral variation) is presented in detail via specific instances of district-level energy modeling for the city of Vienna, Austria. © 2017, Tsinghua University Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - The objective of obtaining high performance energy buildings can be reached considering the contemporaneous effects of technical characteristics and occupancy. Recent studies report that as buildings become more energy efficient, the behavior of occupants plays an increasing role in consumption. Therefore, a construction designed to be a Nearly Zero Energy Building (nZEB) might generate higher consumption than expected if the assumptions made in the simulation process are not respected during the real use. The occupant can modify the control strategies of internal variables (heating/cooling system operation, set point temperature, ventilation, lighting) and the users’ behavior has a high impact on the utilization of plants and equipment. A significant contribution is also represented by the internal gains that have a direct relation with occupancy. The aim of this study is to assess the influence of housing occupancy patterns on the definition of residential nZEB in Italian climatic conditions. The investigation has been carried out considering a case study consisting of a building designed according to the National Standards. Successively, different conditions of the building usage are analyzed using dynamic energy simulations that allow exploration of the different occupation modes. The variability of the family composition and the occupancy scenarios are defined based on the data collected in the specific context. The investigation provides information regarding the effects of human variables (occupants’ needs and preferences) on the final energy performance of low energy buildings and highlights the combination of variables that are important in the definition of nZEB as net zero source energy. © 2017, Tsinghua University Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - A poor depiction of occupant behavior in building performance simulation frequently results in substantial divergences between real and simulated results. The problem may be of particular concern with simulation supporting the renovation of older multi-unit residential buildings, buildings whose occupants use windows for temperature control even during heating season. Here, we investigated the impact of window operation models (as well as other occupant behaviors) on simulated energy performance in university residence halls. Based on environmental monitoring, along with information collected from occupant surveys and wearable devices, we estimated air exchange rates and developed a probabilistic window-operation prediction model. The data were collected in 76 dormitory rooms sampled from a pre-renovated historic building and two similar buildings. We then evaluated the window-operation model’s predictive performance in 15 dormitory rooms in the post-renovated building with new occupants. The results of our predictive model were also compared with previously reported window-operation models. We implemented each window-operation model in a calibrated EnergyPlus building performance model, comparing the results of each simulation to metered hourly steam consumption. The impact of the different window operation models on simulated heating energy use was significant (annual error ranging from 0.2% to 10%). Our model demonstrated the highest capability of predicting window state (accuracy=85.8%) and steam use (NMBE=−0.2%); however, some previously published windowoperation models also produced satisfactory performance, implying that such models may be generalizable to some extent. The results suggest that data collected from somewhat ubiquitous indoor environmental quality sensors can glean insights into occupant behavior for building performance simulation. Furthermore, the energy impacts resulting from the variations in occupant behavior studied here were large enough to show that the choice of behavior model can have meaningful implications for real-world applications, such as estimating saving from heating and lighting system upgrades. © 2017, Tsinghua University Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.

AB  - Modern commercial buildings' resource consumption is metered at various levels of spatial and temporal resolution to track and reduce energy use and greenhouse gas emissions. However, not all data that could be used to detect faults or identify efficiency improvements are available due to the cost of meters and inaccessibility of the data they produce. In the field of building operation, building performance simulation (BPS) can help in quantifying unmeasured energy flows, for instance solar gains, heat loss from infiltration, etc. Furthermore, integrating building information modeling (BIM) in building operation and maintenance can decrease operation risk and costs, as well as maintain facility management quality. However, in practice there is a lack of efficient utilization of this application by building operators. The aim of this paper is to provide an integrated framework to estimate and visualize energy flows and the associated cost. The framework consists of 1) developing a BIM model, 2) converting the BIM model to a BPS model, 3) calibrating the model, and 4) visualizing energy and cost flows using Sankey diagrams. The study demonstrates this framework on a real-world case study, and hence provides a comprehensive energy use assessment on the building level to facilitate the decision-making by building operators. Finally, the results of a survey that was deployed to a sample user group to assess the usability and effectiveness of the proposed Sankey diagrams are provided. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This paper presents the evaluation of the level of usability of an intelligent monitoring and control interface for energy efficient management of public buildings, called BuildVis, which forms part of a Building Energy Management System (BEMS.) The BEMS ‘intelligence’ is derived from an intelligent algorithm component which brings together ANN-GA rule generation, a fuzzy rule selection engine, and a semantic knowledge base. The knowledge base makes use of linked data and an integrated ontology to uplift heterogeneous data sources relevant to building energy consumption. The developed ontology is based upon the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC), which is a Building Information Modelling (BIM) standard and consists of two different types of rule model to control and manage the buildings adaptively. The populated rules are a mix of an intelligent rule generation approach using Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Genetic Algorithms (GA), and also data mining rules using Decision Tree techniques on historical data. The resulting rules are triggered by the intelligent controller, which processes available sensor measurements in the building. This generates ‘suggestions’ which are presented to the Facility Manager (FM) on the BuildVis web-based interface. BuildVis uses HTML5 innovations to visualise a 3D interactive model of the building that is accessible over a wide range of desktop and mobile platforms. The suggestions are presented on a zone by zone basis, alerting them to potential energy saving actions. As the usability of the system is seen as a key determinate to success, the paper evaluates the level of usability for both a set of technical users and also the FMs for five European buildings, providing analysis and lessons learned from the approach taken. © 2017

AB  - In the context of environmental policy, the EU has launched a series of initiatives aimed at increasing the use of energy efficiency, as it has pledged to reduce energy consumption by 20%, compared with projected levels of growth of CO2 emissions into the atmosphere by 2020. In Greece CO2 emission levels in the atmosphere have risen significantly over the past two decades [1]. For the year 2011, CO2 emissions per person in Greece correspond to 7.56 t. According to the data, this increase in emissions is reflected to a 151.2% above from the levels of 1980 and a 756% increase from 1960 levels. The building sector consumes the largest amount of energy in Greece, therefore constitutes the most important source of CO2 emissions. The energy upgrade of the building sector produces multiple benefits such as reduced energy consumption, which is consistent with the reduction of air pollution. Additionally, there is a significant improvement at the interior comfort conditions of the building, which promotes productivity and occupant health. Moreover, because of the large number of educational buildings in the country, the energy consumption of them present a significant amount of the country's total energy consumption and simultaneously has the effect of increasing the costs paid by the state budget for the operation and maintenance of public buildings. The investigation of alternative methods to reduce energy consumption in educational buildings is an important approach for sustainability and economic development of the country over time. The purpose of this paper is to study and evaluate the energy saving methods of a university building in Mediterranean climate with significant energy consumption. Additionally, through Building Information Modeling (BIM) and Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) software, studies considering the contribution of passive heating and cooling techniques were conducted, in order to minimize energy consumption in pursuit of desirable interior thermal comfort conditions. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In ventilation systems a considerable amount of energy is used for mass transport of conditioned air to provide the requested volume flows. Reducing volume flow while maintaining indoor air quality has leverage on energy efficiency and is commonly known as Demand Controlled Ventilation (DCV). Current implementations require Variable Air Volume (VAV) controllers to provide a defined volume flow to each room. The controllers measure the pressure difference and adjust the motor flap accordingly. This paper examines an approach that achieves DCV, but replaces the VAV-boxes with simple motor flaps. The missing pressure-drop measurements that allow calculating the volume flow are substituted by a model of the ventilation system. The authors develop a method for calculating the pressure drop in the ducts of a ventilation system that regards the topology and the components of the duct system. This model is coupled with a model for the CO2 concentration in the rooms for all conditioned rooms in order to derive the required air volume flow. Using this model, a linear controller is developed that operates the ventilation system. It is shown that the presented approach operates the ventilation more efficiently, while maintaining comfort constraints and saving installation costs. The modeling effort of the current approach is expected to be reduced with the introduction of the Building Information Model (BIM) into building operation. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The quest for a sustainable built environment has resulted in dramatic changes in the process of residential construction. The new concepts of an integrated design team, building information modeling, commissioning of the building enclosure, and passive house standards have reached maturity. Global work on development of new construction materials has not changed, but their evaluation is not the same as in the past when each material was considered on its own merits. Today, we look at the performance of a building as a system and on the material as a contributor to this system. The series of white papers—a research overview in building physics undertaken in European and North American researchers—is to provide understanding of the process of design and construction for sustainable built environment that involves harmony between different aspects of the environment, society, and economy. Yet, the building physics is changing. It merges with building science in the quest of predicting building performance, it merges concepts of passive houses with solar engineering and integrates building shell with mechanical services, but is still missing an overall vision. Physics does not tell us how to integrate people with their environment. The authors propose a new term buildings with environmental quality management because the vision of the building design must be re-directed toward people. In doing so, the building physics will automatically include durability of the shell, energy efficiency, and carbon emission and aspects such as individual ventilation and indoor climate control. This article, which is part 1 of a series, deals with materials, and other issues will be discussed in following papers. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.

AB  - Energy demand reduction from buildings is widely recognised as a key component of greenhouse gas abatement strategies. As governments shift towards large-scale sectoral interventions, a far more robust research and evidence base is needed to support the development, implementation, and on-going evaluation of energy demand policy. The shift to a low carbon built environment will require both a step change in the energy performance of buildings alongside more efficient provision of energy services, and an aggressive decarbonisation of the energy used. Yet the prerequisite data of building stocks needed to support this essential shift in energy performance of buildings are not necessarily available or are inaccessible or incomplete. As more information on building energy use is collected through high frequency sensors and building form analytics become more sophisticated, the analysis methods applied to the myriad and diverse sub-sectors of the building stock ‘population’ need to be commensurate with the heterogeneity of the building stock. This paper describes and illustrates the basis of the IEA EBC Annex 70: Building Energy Epidemiology, which draws on the health sciences to posit ‘energy epidemiology’ as a whole-system approach for empirical research that provides a methodological framework for building physicists, engineers, social scientists, and economists to engage in cross-disciplinary studies. It makes the case that the development and application of an epidemiological approach to investigating energy demand can advance understanding of the inter-related factors for policy guidance and evaluation and provide insights on the mechanisms that influence energy demand. The aim of the IEA EBC Annex 70 is to work in an international collaboration to identify user needs around energy demand in buildings and to establish best practice methods and harmonized formats for data collection, analysis and modelling. To illustrate this process, we present an example from the UK on the application of energy epidemiological methods to building energy performance in the residential sector. The case study investigates the potential effectiveness of the policy and technical measures proposed by the UK Government. Policy implementation for broad, deep, and urgent reductions in energy demand from the building sector requires a far better understanding of the underlying relationships between people, energy use, buildings and the environment. © 2017 The Authors

AB  - Buildings consume substantial amounts of energy and require sophisticated control strategies to fulfill occupants' comfort requirements. In large spaces, various occupancy patterns result in uneven load distributions, requiring high-resolution occupancy information for sufficient system control. In recent years, the development of indoor positioning systems (IPS) enabled the possibility of more scientific and precise occupancy detection systems, leading to better operation of buildings' HVAC systems. This paper proposes a demand-driven control system for air conditioner control in large spaces based on IPS. The proposed system focuses on optimizing the ventilation rate based on number of occupants and their spatial distribution in an experimental space. A dual-network (Wi-Fi network and BLE network) indoor positioning system is installed to collect the occupancy data and guide the operation of Variable-Air-Volume (VAV) boxes. The energy-saving potential of the proposed system is examined with a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model in terms of temperature distribution and energy consumption. This study also explores the interrelationship between cooling load variation and occupancy pattern under different control mechanisms. The final results show the proposed system has significant energy-saving potential by avoiding over-cooling in unevenly distributed occupancy conditions. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In an effort to complement energy-efficiency oriented methods of environmental building study, this research seeks to understand building as a metabolic thermodynamic network, and investigates performance and sustainability with system-level principles and biological indicators. This approach introduces two system evaluation metrics: (i) solar emjoule (sej) of emergy (spelled with an “m”) and (ii) bits of information. In this way, emergy-information indicates the intensive organization of building energy flux in association with global environment development. Findings from a comparative analysis of a net-zero energy building (NZEB) and a non-NZEB show that buildings increase network complexity, resilience, and adaptability as they reduce nonrenewable inputs with energy feedback loops. The consistent tendency of maximizing information and complexity at the expense of efficiency demonstrates that building thermodynamic networking parallels the general ecosystems developmental phenomenon –maximum power at optimal efficiency. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The requirements imposed by AEC (Architecture/Engineering/Construction) projects with regard to data storage and execution, on-demand data sharing and complexity on building simulations have led to utilising novel computing techniques. In detail, these requirements refer to storing the large amounts of data that the AEC industry generates — from building schematics to associated data derived from different contractors that are involved at various stages of the building lifecycle; or running simulations on building models (such as energy efficiency, environmental impact & occupancy simulations). Creating such a computing infrastructure to support operations deriving from various AEC projects can be challenging due to the complexity of workflows, distributed nature of the data and diversity of roles, profiles and location of the users. Federated clouds have provided the means to create a distributed environment that can support multiple individuals and organisations to work collaboratively. In this study we present how multi-site construction projects can be coordinated by the use of federated clouds where the interacting parties are represented by AEC industry organisations. We show how coordination can support (a) data sharing and interoperability using a multi-vendor Cloud environment and (b) process interoperability based on various stakeholders involved in the AEC project lifecycle. We develop a framework that facilitates project coordination with associated “issue status” implications and validate our outcome in a real construction project. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Uncertainty quantification for Energy Savings Performance Contracting: Application to an office building

AU  - Faggianelli, G.A.

AB  - Building energy models are widely used to estimate or predict the average energy consumption of a building. However, they only provide approximate figures with significant uncertainties. Particular uses such as energy performance guarantee require more reliable results in order to set suitable contracts. For this purpose, uncertainty quantification can be used to support modeling phase and results interpretation. The aim of this paper is to present a comprehensive methodology applied to an office building. First, sensitivity analysis allows users to identify and prioritize the most influential inputs of their model. Non-influential inputs can then be fixed to their nominal values, without impacting the results. The remaining set of parameters makes it possible to assess quantitative measures such as Sobol’ indices which give useful information on the model variance. Different methods are suitable for such calculations but generally rely on specific sample design. Meta-model reduction based on Polynomial Chaos Expansion can be used as a post-processing method and appears to be the best compromise between accuracy and computation time for our case study. This approach also involves the use of probability density function and cumulative distribution to calculate confidence intervals and probability to exceed a threshold value. At last, the importance of using adjustment variables to take into account time-varying parameters is also discussed. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - As Building Information Modeling evolves into becoming the central mean for coordinating project design and planning activities, we notice a few limitations/opportunities in the way current BIM tools address the needs for integrated design, collaboration and analysis (the initial objective of BIM). First, substantial communications and interactions about the design exist outside the BIM environment — typically in e-mail formats. This may cause distractions, delays to the project, and could waste valuable knowledge (contained in these interactions). Second, the need of engaging end-users and their keen interest in selecting “green” features. Professionals can develop different designs that achieve varying levels of energy conservation, but these will always require changes based on usage patterns. So, it is important that end-users are involved in the design process early on to make sure that they receive adequate information/ education before they make decisions. This is the nature of limitations that we try to address in this research. This paper builds around the design and development of an online system, named Green2.0 that tries to leverage advancements in Building Information Models (BIM), energy-efficiency simulation tools, and online social network analysis methods to enable a data-driven approach to building planning, construction and maintenance. Fundamentally, it allows participants (end-users or professionals) to comment and share views about building designs. Social network analysis and semantic modeling tools are then used to extract information from these interactions. At the same time, it connects BIM to energy analysis software to allow users to select different products from a catalog and assess the impact of each on energy consumption. The platform aims to advance the current state of the art by bringing about a fundamental shift in the way that AEC professionals, end-users and public policy makers work together throughout a building's lifecycle. Designed as an open platform, it provides access to information that enables researchers and practitioners to build new, more efficient theories and methods of building design. The premise of our work is that by providing new insights into the building design process it is likely to have a profound beneficial effect for both AEC professionals and the society at large. © 2017

TI  - Modelling the relationship between heating energy use and indoor temperatures in residential buildings through Artificial Neural Networks considering occupant behavior
PY  - 2017

AU  - Horta, I.M.
AB  - The heating energy demand stated in energy performance certificates (EPC) and in other instruments used in the of evaluation of building's energy performance is usually determined assuming very specific (reference) indoor behavioral/heating patterns. Particularly, they tend to assume that households heat (nearly) the entire house to a “comfort” temperature during (nearly) all the heating season. However, several field studies have shown that there are major niches of the housing stock which do not follow this pattern (even the majority, in some geographical areas). Considering this matter, it would be interesting to build models able to estimate heating energy use values resultant from occupation and heating patterns different from those considered as “reference”. This work aimed at producing tools to assess the relationship between heating energy use and indoor temperatures at different levels of occupant behavior (in terms of where, when and at what temperature households heat their dwellings). This relationship was expressed through models while still takes advantage of the information from the certificates. The work developed artificial neural networks (ANN) that characterize the relationship between heating energy use, indoor temperatures and the heating energy demand under reference conditions (typically available from energy rating/certificates) in the residential buildings, for different occupant behaviors/heating patterns. Theoretically, these models can be applicable to any national geographical context. The data for building the ANNs was obtained from dynamic thermal building simulations using ESP-r, considering a large number of housing types and hypothetical occupation and heating patterns (i.e., which parts of the house are heated, when and at what temperature). From the analysis performed, it was possible to conclude that the developed ANN models proved to perform well (R2 &gt; 0.93) in estimating either heating energy use or indoor temperature, both at an individual and at the building stock level. This work may have important contributions in the energy planning practices regarding the residential building stock. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - With the approaching of cloud and big data computing era, renewable energy such as solar energy is increasingly integrated into data center power provisioning systems. Nevertheless, the power statistics collection may not be possible or available due to the fact that renewable energy supply exhibits intermittency, time varying behavior (e.g. shortage or failure), resulting in missing data. In this paper, we propose a filling algorithm based on complete tolerance class to solve the missing of energy big data issue. Note that traditional method based on rough sets will likely to fail when there is severe missing data, and its solution on tolerance relation and tolerance class is more complex, which is not suitable for the large scale and the time varying energy big data. Our proposed algorithm expands the tolerance relation into the complete tolerance relation to partition the complete tolerance class. Moreover, our algorithm fills the missing attribute values of the energy big data in data center, which ensures the data integrity and improve the classification accuracy. We further parallelize and optimize our algorithm on state-of-the-art Spark cluster computing framework. In addition, we propose the adaptive management architecture that handles incomplete energy big data in green data centers. Our proposed architecture integrates the techniques for preprocessing energy data, filling incomplete energy data and building decision model. It increases the power assignment efficiency between solar power and utility, while enhancing load performance and service availability. As a result, it can provide better service for green data centers. We perform comprehensive experiments on an energy data set and the results show the Completing Incomplete Big Data (CIBD) algorithm can guarantee the completeness of data while improving the filling accuracy by 10% compared to general filling algorithms such as MEAN or ERS. The proposed algorithm and architecture show more benefit as the data missing rate increases. We further utilize the filled data to establish the random forest model and yield desirable results. Compared to the Hadoop based filling algorithm, the processing speed of the CIBD algorithm improves by 50% on the 4GB data size. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Considering that the largest part of end-use energy consumption worldwide is associated with the buildings sector, there is an inherent need for the conceptualization, specification, implementation, and instantiation of novel solutions in smart buildings, able to achieve significant reductions in energy consumption through the adoption of energy efficient techniques and the active engagement of the occupants. Towards the design of such solutions, the identification of the main energy consuming factors, trends, and patterns, along with the appropriate modeling and understanding of the occupants’ behavior and the potential for the adoption of environmentallyfriendly lifestyle changes have to be realized. In the current article, an innovative energy-aware information technology (IT) ecosystem is presented, aiming to support the design and development of novel personalized energy management and awareness services that can lead to occupants’ behavioral change towards actions that can have a positive impact on energy efficiency. Novel information and communication technologies (ICT) are exploited towards this direction, related mainly to the evolution of the Internet of Things (IoT), data modeling, management and fusion, big data analytics, and personalized recommendation mechanisms. The combination of such technologies has resulted in an open and extensible architectural approach able to exploit in a homogeneous, efficient and scalable way the vast amount of energy, environmental, and behavioral data collected in energy efficiency campaigns and lead to the design of energy management and awareness services targeted to the occupants’ lifestyles. The overall layered architectural approach is detailed, including design and instantiation aspects based on the selection of set of available technologies and tools. Initial results from the usage of the proposed energy aware IT ecosystem in a pilot site at the University of Murcia are presented along with a set of identified open issues for future research. © 2017 by the authors.

AB  - Reducing carbon emissions and addressing environmental policies in the construction domain has been intensively explored with solutions ranging from energy efficiency techniques with building informatics to user behavior modelling and monitoring. Such strategies have managed to improve current practices in managing buildings, however decarbonizing the built environment and reducing the energy performance gap remains a complex undertaking that requires more comprehensive and sustainable solutions. In this context, building information modelling (BIM), can help the sustainability agenda as the digitalization of product and process information provides a unique opportunity to optimize energy-efficiency-related decisions across the entire lifecycle and supply chain. BIM is foreseen as a means to waste and emissions reduction, performance gap minimization, in-use energy enhancements, and total lifecycle assessment. It also targets the whole supply chain related to design, construction, as well as management and use of facilities, at the different qualifications levels (including blue-collar workers). In this paper, we present how building information modelling can be utilized to address energy efficiency in buildings in the operation phase, greatly contributing to achieving carbon emissions targets. In this paper, we provide two main contributions: (i) we present a BIM-oriented methodology for supporting building energy optimization, based on which we identify few training directions with regards to BIM, and (ii) we provide an application use case as identified in the European research project "Sporte2" to demonstrate the advantages of BIM in energy efficiency with respect to several energy metrics. © 2017 by the authors.

AB  - The high demand for energy-efficiency of buildings nowadays has triggered the need for gathering documentation on existing construction conditions. This information is then used to design buildings with high consideration to the site or to allow the renovation of old buildings that can no longer meet the requirements for energy performance or comfortable living. The documentation required for this type of situation is often outdated or missing, and to create an optimal design the existing conditions need to be registered and analysed using advanced technological methods, such as Building Information Modelling (BIM) and 3D laser scanning.

AB  - In the face of a rapidly changing climate and global energy crisis, this study proposes the concept of green building information modeling (Green BIM), and suggests the use of a decision-making cycle when performing building performance analysis (BPA) to obtain design proposals with optimized environmental effectiveness in response to local climate conditions when BIM is used as a basic tool from the beginning of the design process. Taking building energy performance analysis as an example, in comparison with other domestic and foreign research, the important contributions of the study include: (1) Based on a design decision-making perspective, a Green BIM-based decision-making cycle can integrate the practical steps of BIM and BPA. (2) Furthermore, this study also finds that meteorological data in a format that can be used in BPA is not easy to obtain. Nevertheless, virtual weather station technology developed using cloud technology can enable a building project to obtain simulated meteorological data relying on weather stations closest to the required criteria, and a cloud building energy analysis engine can be used to implement complex analysis involving large amount of data. As a result, the use of green-BIM technology and concepts can be promoted with greater ease. When setting energy conservation targets, this study recommends that building energy usage intensity (EUI) be employed as an integrated performance indicator for energy consumption, and percentage of performance optimization be employed as a rating criterion. Nevertheless, the use of energy conservation targets is not essential; depending on the directions in which national governments would like to lead the industry and the maturity and feasibility of relevant technologies, other feasible high-performance benchmarks proposed in this study may also be used in Green BIM. © 2017 CAD Solutions, LLC.

AB  - Multi-energy systems satisfy different energy uses of a building such as space heating, space cooling, DHW, etc. by using different energy converters and energy sources simultaneously. These systems, if properly designed and operated, have high efficiency in the production of energy. This paper presents a method based on the Energy Hub model for the energy and economic analysis of a large hospital complex placed in Sardinia (Italy). The Energy Hub model allows dynamic simulations results and experimental data to be coupled. First of all, the model was calibrated according to real data and information obtained during an energy audit carried out by the University of Cagliari in collaboration with the Brotzu Hospital staff. Then, since cogeneration is recognised as one of the most effective ways to efficiently convert energy, the integration of a CHP system (internal combustion engine), within the multi-energy system of the hospital, was studied. The results obtained are useful to identify benefits that might be obtained by the CHP system, depending on its regulation and on the economic variables. The presented model represents a valuable tool to evaluate possible energy and economic savings and to design and to optimise every kind of multi-energy systems of a generic building. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Energy prediction models are used in buildings as a performance evaluation engine in advanced control and optimisation, and in making informed decisions by facility managers and utilities for enhanced energy efficiency. Simplified and data-driven models are often the preferred option where pertinent information for detailed simulation are not available and where fast responses are required. We compared the performance of the widely-used feed-forward back-propagation artificial neural network (ANN) with random forest (RF), an ensemble-based method gaining popularity in prediction – for predicting the hourly HVAC energy consumption of a hotel in Madrid, Spain. Incorporating social parameters such as the numbers of guests marginally increased prediction accuracy in both cases. Overall, ANN performed marginally better than RF with root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 4.97 and 6.10 respectively. However, the ease of tuning and modelling with categorical variables offers ensemble-based algorithms an advantage for dealing with multi-dimensional complex data, typical in buildings. RF performs internal cross-validation (i.e. using out-of-bag samples) and only has a few tuning parameters. Both models have comparable predictive power and nearly equally applicable in building energy applications. © 2017 The Authors

AB  - According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), the residential sector accounts for one-third of the country's energy consumption. This number is steadily increasing, posing a challenge to energy regulators as well as suppliers. To manage the growing demand for energy, there is a need for energy system optimization, especially on the demand side. This paper uses a first principles approach to build a high-resolution energy demand model, which can be used as a test bed by academicians as well as policy makers for performing such optimizations. This framework generates activity-based, building-level, time-dependent demand profiles. The model associates appliance usage with each household activity and calculates energy consumption based on the appliance energy rating, the duration of the energy consuming activity, and the type of activity performed by each household member. It also accounts for shared activities among household members to avoid double counting. Additionally, passive energy consumptions such as space heating/cooling, lighting, etc., are measured. Finally, validation of the results obtained by this model against real-world data for Virginia is carried out. The results indicate that the modeling framework is robust and can be extended to other parts of the U.S. and beyond. © 2017 IEEE.

AB  - We cannot effectively reduce the carbon-related urban energy use without first having a good method for measuring it at an effective scale. Most prior research has usually considered the energy consumption of buildings and transport separately, but urban energy use is better understood when both uses of energy are considered together. This paper introduces a new energy use metric that combines the energy consumption of both buildings and transport. Estimates are calculated from readily available data and the simplicity of the methodology enables its replicability. This is attractive for policy-makers and planners by delivering them tools of more direct control of local-level policies. Using a LSOA geographic level and mapping the results produces helpful insights into energy consumption patterns and how the two uses of energy can be combined to support mitigation measures. When applying the methodology to a case study in the United Kingdom, maps produced show, amongst other things, how rural commuter belts are disproportionately energy-hungry when assessed per capita. Urban living is revealed as most energy efficient at this level. The integrated modelling approach demonstrated here improves the understanding of consumption patterns to enable better planning of strategies to reduce energy demand and its negative impact. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - To support the appropriate default value assignment in design performance modeling (DPM), which is defined as energy/performance simulations in the concept and schematic stages of the design process, a methodology for creating maps of the recommended window-to-wall ratio (WWR) is proposed using integrated simulations and optimizations. A case study is conducted to create maps of recommended WWR in Japan. The distribution of the optimal WWR under varying design conditions exhibits three distinct patterns: (i) As the WWR decreases, the CO2 emissions decrease. (ii) An appropriate WWR value exists (30–50%) at which the CO2 emissions are minimized. (iii) As the WWR increases, the CO2 emissions decrease. Five design conditions of lighting power density, climate, window orientation, internal gains, and building scale are examined in this investigation. The results of the quantitative evaluation indicate that the lighting power density, climate, and window orientation significantly impact the optimal WWR configuration. The optimization results of 10 locations in four main orientations with two lighting power densities (10 W/m2 and 5 W/m2) are processed according to the optimal WWR distribution patterns to generate the recommended WWR maps for Japan. The maps provide architects with the information needed to determine the setting direction of default WWR values for DPM. For example, a larger WWR is recommended for buildings in zones 6–8 of the Japanese climate regions for the current lighting power density (10 W/m2), except for eastern facades. In contrast, a moderate or smaller WWR default value should be carefully assigned according to the window orientation in zones 4–8 when the lighting efficiency improves (i.e., for a lighting power density of 5 W/m2). © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Uncertainty is an inherent characteristic of decision making related to sustainable construction projects. The main reason for this uncertainty is the incomplete information available to stakeholders on the relative impact of their decision criteria and the full consequences of the sustainability decisions on the projects' financial and environmental performance. One of the critical decisions made to achieve the objectives of sustainable construction projects is the choice of credits that qualify projects for certification by sustainability rating systems like Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED). The objective of this paper is to create an objective methodology for the sustainability credit selection along with a modeling tool that incorporates the proposed methodology and then compare the performance of this tool with that of the commonly used cognitive approaches to decision making. Therefore, structured interviews were held with industry professionals, the results of which are used to develop an ordered-probit statistical model that identifies the significant independent parameters affecting the subject credit-selection decisions. Subsequently, the proposed credit-selection methodology is developed based on the ELECTRE III technique and compared with the intuition-based approach. The validation of the model results is performed by comparing the model output with credits actually selected in a number of actual projects targeting certification by LEED and the Qatar Sustainability Rating System (QSAS). The results of this comparison indicate that the developed methodology is capable of providing valuable guidance in the credit-selection process in the early stage of project design. The methodology also provides a systematic and consistent way for credit selection based on in-depth analyses of the evaluation criteria and perceived project priorities. © 2017 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB  - Many studies have documented that retro-commissioning provides energy savings ranging between 10 and 30%; in some cases, more than 50% of a building's energy consumption. Over the past two decades, retro-commissioning has evolved from being mostly a manual process to using functional testing to a semi-automated process of using monitored data to identify operational problems. Many of the issues that the retro-commissioning process identifies relate to the inability to manage and maintain building systems and controls associated with those systems. Even though retro-commissioning has proven to be cost-effective, only a small fraction of the buildings are commissioned and many buildings that are commissioned only implement a fraction of recommend retro-commissioning actions. Two primary reasons for lack of interest in retro-commissioning is a perception that: (1) retro-commissioning is expensive and (2) many retro-commissioning measures lack persistence. Many cities in the United States are mandating that some of the commercial building stock be commissioned periodically. Automation and leveraging emerging building information modeling standards can alleviate many of the concerns of retro-commissioning by providing a mechanism for automated continuous condition-based maintenance. This article describes one such reference process that can be deployed to provide continuous automated condition-based maintenance management for buildings that have building information modeling, building automation systems, and computerized maintenance management software systems. The process can be deployed using an open-source transactional network platform, VOLTTRON™, designed for distributed sensing and controls and supports both energy efficiency and grid services. © 2017, Copyright © Battelle Memorial Institute.

AB  - Residential energy conservation and efficiency programs are strategic interventions to reduce consumption and increase affordability. However, the inability to identify and distinguish between high energy consumers and highly energy inefficient households has led to ineffective program targeting. Additionally, little is known about the spatial, racial and socioeconomic patterns of urban residential energy consumption and efficiency. Publicly available data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration and the U.S. Census Bureau are used with bottom-up modeling and small-area estimation techniques to predict mean annual heating consumption and energy use intensity (EUI), an energy efficiency proxy, at the census block group level in Detroit (Wayne County), Michigan. Using geographic information systems, results illustrate spatial disparities in energy consumption and EUI. Bivariate analysis show no statistical relationship between race/ethnicity and energy consumption; however, EUI is correlated with racial/ethnic makeup; percent White (−0.28), African American (0.24) and Hispanic (0.16). Income and housing tenure reveal inverse relationships with consumption and efficiency. Though areas with higher median incomes and homeownership exhibited higher consumption (0.28 and 0.56, respectively), they had lower EUIs (−0.48 and −0.38, respectively). This study provides evidence supporting approaches for conservation and energy efficiency program targeting that recognizes the significance of race, ethnicity, place and class. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Although providing both aesthetic and environmental benefits, previous research has identified limitations with the existing green roof technologies, including higher construction cost, long term maintenance requirements, damages to structure, roof leakage, among others. In order to break the above-mentioned limitations, this paper presents the application of the generic eco-innovation model to develop a design alternative of a green roof that is eco-friendlier, more durable, and more cost-effective, compared with existing ones. A case study incorporating building information modeling technology and energy consumption analysis software was conducted to demonstrate the benefits of the innovative green roof proposed by the generic eco-innovation model. The case study results show that the proposed eco-innovative alternative can reduce more than 20 % of energy consumption of traditional roof. It is thus concluded that the generic eco-innovation model provides a promising tool for engineers/architect in achieving more sustainable construction during the design phase. © 2017 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

TI  - A quantitative method for assessing home envelope's energy performance using measured data
PY  - 2017
AU  - Shi, J.
AB  - This research develops a unique inverse method for assessing a residential home envelope's energy performance based on measured data. The method is built on the balancing principle that the heat that is generated by the heating equipment equals the heat that is lost to the outdoor environment through the building's envelope. This heat generation vs. loss balancing process continues over time, being characterized by the heating equipment's operating cycles. An actual home in the cold climate zone is used as a case study with outdoor temperature varying between 12.9 and 57.6°F. The obtained results show that the given home's heat loss is linearly correlated to the indoor‒outdoor temperature difference. They also indicate that measured data can provide reliable information for assessing and benchmarking a building envelope's energy performance. In comparison to a forward building energy modelling and simulation method, the proposed inverse method can provide accurate results, with much less effort needed for an existing building. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Occupants’ behaviours are a major determinant of energy use in buildings. The related savings potential has been insufficiently exploited. Although research has addressed behavioural savings through real-world interventions and quantitative modelling approaches, it has not yet explored the full variety of household activities. This work proposes an integrative modelling approach of energy behaviours in the residential setting as a tool to estimate the behavioural impact of households on energy consumption. It uses building energy performance simulation (BEPS) tools to exploit the behavioural savings potential associated with usage and investment energy behaviours when using different energy services in daily household activities. Simulations have estimated significant behavioural savings potential associated with energy behaviours, which may be materialized if some forms of behaviour are induced. Investment behaviours have higher savings potential than usage behaviours, and the behavioural savings potential per energy service is proportional to the energy consumption breakdown. BEPS tools enable a quantitative estimate of the behavioural impact on energy consumption, but further improvements to these tools are needed to incorporate the complexity of behavioural dimensions. Estimating the behavioural savings potential is important for a more effective design of behaviour change interventions, which in turn will support more effective energy efficiency policies. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - When designing buildings, it is a challenge to take into account Energy Efficiency in the early design stage. This is especially difficult for hospital designs, because these buildings comprise many different room types and functions. This greatly increases the number of design directions available. Choices made early on in the design process have a large impact on the final performance of the building. However, the lack of detailing available in early designs makes it hard to evaluate them in terms of Key Performance Indicators. The Semantic Labels developed as part of the STREAMER project provide a way to address this problem, by allowing structured capture of the most relevant aspects of the Program of Requirements. Using this method, design rules can be applied to early building designs to detect and correct inconsistencies or suboptimal solutions. Also, using default values for label values, an early design can already be evaluated using simulation tools. The Semantic labels describe standard values for Construction (floor height and strength, accessibility), Hygiene class (from public spaces to operational theatres), Equipment (electric power requirements, safety), User profile (when the room is used), Comfort class (like daylight) and Access security (who can enter). Design rules may express conditions like the preferred spatial separation between rooms, or whether rooms should be placed at outer walls, but may also highlight incompatibilities in e.g. access requirements and user profiles. The Early Design Configurator, also under development as part of the STREAMER project, uses the Semantic Labels to allow automatic conversion of a Programme of Requirements, into an initial Building Information Modeling (BIM) design proposal that respects the design rules. © 2016 by author(s) and VsI Entrepreneurship and Sustainability Center.

AB  - Given the ability of building information models (BIM) to serve as a multidisciplinary data repository, this study attempts to explore and exploit the sustainability value of BIM in delivering buildings that require less energy for operations, emit less carbon dioxide, and provide conducive living environments for occupants. This objective was attained by a critical and extensive literature review that covers the following: (1) building energy consumption, (2) building energy performance and analysis, and (3) BIM and energy assessment. Literature cited in this paper shows that linking an energy analysis tool with a BIM model has helped project design teams to predict and create optimized energy consumption by conducting building energy performance analysis utilizing key performance indicators on average thermal transmitters, resulting heat demand, lighting power, solar heat gains, and ventilation heat losses. An in-depth analysis was conducted on a completed BIM integrated construction project utilizing the Arboleda Project in the Dominican Republic to validate the aforementioned findings. Results show that the BIM-based energy analysis helped the design team attain the world׳s first positive energy building. This study concludes that linking an energy analysis tool with a BIM model helps to expedite the energy analysis process, provide more detailed and accurate results, and deliver energy-efficient buildings. This study further recommends that the adoption of level 2 BIM and BIM integration in energy optimization analysis must be demanded by building regulatory agencies for all projects regardless of procurement method (i.e., government funded or otherwise) or size. © 2017 The Authors

TI  - Green Building Rating Systems and Whole-Building Life Cycle Assessment: Comparative Study of the Existing Assessment Tools
PY  - 2017
AU  - Al-Ghamdi, S.G.
AU  - Bilec, M.M.
AB  - There is a growing interest in integrating life cycle assessment (LCA) into building design decision making due to LCA's comprehensive and systemic approach to environmental evaluation. Many green building rating systems (GBRSs) use LCA to various degrees. In this paper, a comparative study was performed to evaluate the LCA software tools available to building designers. A whole-building LCA was performed for a large building using three software LCA tools. The software tools vary in key aspects, such as intended users (e.g., LCA experts or novices), design stage in which they can be used, and time. The evaluated LCA tools varied significantly in the possibility of their use in early design and decision making. Some of the applications rely on a bill of materials that changes constantly in design alterations. However, others showed a greater advantage in that they can be integrated from the beginning of the design process. The comparative LCA results indicated that the impact of LCA software is dependent on the impact category and the precision in the process of material quantities takeoff. The case study was influenced by the building type and its intense operational energy requirements. Conventional energy efficiency measures, such as increasing the lighting efficiency, far exceeded what can be done to mitigate the embedded impact of construction materials. Thus, advancing the requirements of the LCA baseline building and addressing the operational phase in a more comprehensive framework are discussed. Finally, this paper examines the traditional building's systems that are usually involved in LCA and the possibility of adding other systems, such as plumbing, HVAC, and electrical systems, using building information modeling (BIM). © 2016 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB  - An approach to intelligent building energy management systems at the workplace level has the potential to save energy through the use of building information modeling (BIM) and smart sensor systems. Its development focuses on micro-climatization and real-time digitalization systems from an architect's point of view. Intelligent management systems (IMSs) have significant potential for energy savings, but they have not been fully used in buildings and cities. Smart sensor systems based on user behavior will improve indoor environmental quality (IEQ) and user comfort. A cost-effective strategy has been implemented by using a low-technology and high-performance approach. This work aims to reduce energy consumption and provide comfort conditions by learning user behavior. Furthermore, it seeks to create a real-time system with regard to the functions of developed technologies. In order to improve energy efficiency and comfort conditions, smart sensor systems and digital simulation tools play a crucial role in finding optimal solutions to optimization problems. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Multimodels — Instant nD-modeling using original data

AU  - Fuchs, S.

AB  - The exchange and provision of interdisciplinary information is a key to leverage of sophisticated cross-domain BIM applications like project controlling, simulations, energy efficiency or building automation. Thereby existing data formats, domain applications and information processes must be retained as far as possible. As current interoperability methods cannot cope with this challenge satisfactorily, the multimodel method is presented here, which enables interdisciplinary construction information processes on the base of original data. A multimodel therefore combines heterogeneous models of different domains. The loose cross-model coupling of data elements is neutrally stored in external ID-based link models. As the single domain models remain unaffected, they can still be used by traditional applications. Because of the absence of a leading or integrating data scheme, no transformation processes are required, common established data formats can be reused and the linked domain models can be exchanged neutrally. The linked data in multimodels offers an additional value of information in contrast to the single domain models. Information belonging together can be automatically evaluated by the persistent links. Thus, a multimodel appears to a user as a single self-contained information space. While the method focuses on closed world data exchange scenarios, it is not intended to form a singular project information space. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Implementing compact and energy-efficient synaptic elements using nanoscale memristors has elicited widespread interest in building neural network circuits. Not only can the memristive neural network offer powerful computation capability, but it also exhibits intelligent behaviors such as cognition and associative memory. In this paper, a memristor-based associative memory neural network (m-ASNN) with properties of associative memory and memory losing is designed and further used to reflect some human affections in social relationships. Specifically, a voltage-controlled memristor model with a programming threshold and forgetting property is proposed and employed as the 1 M (memristor) electronic synapse. Such a memristor synapse can learn and store information, and is plastic to the activities of its presynaptic and postsynaptic neurons, like biological synapses. Furthermore, an M-ASNN consisting of the memristor synapse as well as inhibitory and excitatory neurons is built to model the forming, keeping and losing of some affections in social relationships. Finally, an analog implementation of the M-ASNN based on PSPICE is presented and simulated. The novel modeling and implementation of human affections using memristor devices may create new opportunities for affection computing as well as applications of memristive neural networks. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Addressing air leakage and its influencing factors in buildings is very important for further improvement of buildings' energy efficiency. The evaluation of how energy use is influenced by the design parameters of buildings is also crucial for architects in early design stages when there is a need for rapid assessment of the effect of minor and major design changes in overall energy demand. This paper helps fill the information gap on predictive models for this field, which became evident during literature review. This work examines the relationship between energy demand, air-tightness, and their influencing factors including volume, treated floor area, building age, compactness, window-to-wall ratio, and frame-length factor of 18 dwellings constructed between 2005 and 2014 in Estonia. The buildings involved in the study are mostly energy-efficient buildings, e.g., there were two passive houses and one net-zero energy building that also qualifies as a plus-energy building. The paper employs the ANOVA to compare the means of air tightness and energy demand in relation to other individual factors. Important contributions of this paper include two novel linear functions to predict energy demand based on four and seven common building variables. This proof-of-concept approach demonstrates a possible paradigm shift for the building industry, where such predictive equations derived by multiple approaches and using conventional parameters can serve as a practically useful guide for designers at early stages of the design process to achieve energy efficiency. The findings from the developed predictive model for estimating the energy demand of dwellings with the multiple-regression technique should contribute in predicting the influence of design parameters on achieving air tightness and energy efficiency on buildings. © 2016 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB  - Facility managers are required to collect high-quality data to achieve corrective maintenance actions. Current facility management (FM) information systems are complex and provide high-quality data. However, they lack interoperability and visualization capabilities. The goal of this study is to improve the quality of data collected that is required for corrective maintenance by utilizing visualization and interoperability capabilities of building information modeling (BIM). To achieve that, an approach that implements industry foundation classes (IFC) BIM to link and present alarms reported by FM systems, such as building energy management systems (BEMS) and building automation systems (BAS), with related data from computerized maintenance management systems (CMMS) was developed and validated on a typical university building. The results showed an efficiency increase in high-quality maintenance data collection. The proposed approach supplements the existing body of knowledge in the FM domain by providing a schema that integrates corrective maintenance data in a three-dimensional (3D) IFC-BIM environment. Moreover, it provides a process to minimize the corrective maintenance lead-time and link equipment failures to the related maintenance information. FM practitioners can use this approach to decrease the lead-time needed corrective maintenance responses and focus their resources on productive maintenance tasks. © 2016 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB  - Heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems in commercial buildings consume the largest amount of energy. Recent surge in energy cost necessitates constant re-evaluation of HVAC system for most of the buildings. The objective of this study is to present the strategic approach on energy saving analysis of the HVAC system and chiller sizing optimization for a library building. Energy modeling code (eQUEST) for buildings simulation has been applied to verify and predict the long-term energy consumption of HVAC systems. To improve the accuracy of simulation results, the actual performance curves of the chillers and pumps were the inputs of curve fitting data from on-site field measurements data. Energy consumption data acquisition from the building energy management system (BEMS) for one year has been conducted comprehensively to calibrate energy modeling and to quantify energy saving results. The results revealed good agreement between energy modeling and BEMS data with the error of less than 10%. Besides, energy savings through the chillers’ sizing based on cooling load profile could be achieved satisfactorily by utilizing energy modeling by using the actual chiller performance curve. The energy saving for HVAC system can be obtained satisfactorily at the saving of 110,362 kWh per year. It is expected that the study will stimulate a more robust investigation of energy-efficient and cost-effective HVAC system specific for library buildings. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - The European Energy Efficiency Directive requests the application of high quality and cost effective energy audits across Europe. The potential of up to 20% of energy savings shall be realized to follow the strategy of smart, sustainable, and inclusive growth. A number of barriers must be tackled to implement the Directive, especially among small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs). A large number of cost effective energy efficiency measures remains unimplemented because of financial reasons, a lack of information, and limited in-house skills. Information measures, audits, capacity buildings are suggested as potentially effective measures to support implementation of energy efficiency measures. Within the work described in this paper, an auditing approach was developed, focusing on modelling the energy consumption of an SME. The model of the energy consumption is built using simple MS Excel tools, dividing the process into unit operations and attributing annual consumption to these units, from measurements or by calculation. Consumption is linked to drivers of consumption and corresponding losses, thus developing an understanding of the origin of energy consumption, priorities, and the potential for reduction. The approach simultaneously addresses the needs for the identification of measures, capacity building, information and awareness raising. The auditing approach was tested with 280 companies in Austria, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Italy, Romania, Slovakia and Spain. A wide range of energy efficiency measures was identified and implemented, partly consisting of no-cost options, but partly also innovative technical solutions. Over EUR 10 million investments with a simple payback time of less than three years were triggered. 6500 toe per year of primary energy savings were realized, as well as greenhouse gas emission reductions of 13,500 tonnes per year. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The demand for sustainable buildings has been highly increasing over the past few years. To meet the sustainability requirements of a building, changes or decisions must be made to a building during the design and preconstruction stages. This can be possible using Building Information Modelling (BIM). To demonstrate the use of BIM in sustainable design, a villa is taken for model study. The conventional building performance is analysed using Autodesk Revit which included various parameters like energy use intensity, lifecycle energy use/cost, annual carbon emissions, monthly heating and cooling loads, monthly peak demand and monthly electricity and fuel consumption. By employing the use of green materials in the conventional building model, the conventional building model is modified into a green building model. Using BIM, the use of artificial resources can be greatly reduced by replacing them with the use of renewable energy resources thereby saving energy. To show how efficient BIM is, the results of the performance of the conventional and green building models are compared. BIM has proved to be efficient in achieving sustainability with earlier decision making and rectification of errors.

AB  - Population growth, rapid economic development, and urbanisation have increased the demand for energy worldwide leading to increased levels of CO2 emissions, and, consequently, contributing to global warming. More than 40% of this energy is consumed in buildings. Assessing energy performance of existing buildings with the goal of determining an optimal rehabilitation strategy offers a chance to reduce the rising demands for energy. Several studies have advocated and demonstrated the energy savings from energydriven renovations of existing commercial and residential buildings. This paper builds on these studies by developing a framework for completing renovation projects of existing buildings. The theoretical framework is generic in nature and can be applied to any facility that is looking for ways to enhance its energy efficiency. Implementing the framework is expected to lead to significant savings in energy consumption, resulting in both economic and environmental benefits. Copyright © 2017 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

AB  - Food industry is the production sector with the highest energy consumption. In Europe, the energy used to produce food accounts for 26% of total energy consumption. Over 28% is used in industrial processes. Recently, European food companies have increased their efforts to make their production processes more sustainable, also by giving preference to the use of renewable energy sources. In Italy, the total energy consumption in agriculture and food sectors decreased between 2013 and 2014, passing from 16.79 to 13.3 Mtep. Since energy consumption in food industry is nearly twice the one in agriculture (8.57 and 4.73 Mtep, respectively), it is very important to improve energy efficiency and use green technologies in all the phases of food processing and conservation. In Italy, a recent law (Legislative Decree 102, 04/07/2014) has made energy-use diagnosis compulsory for all industrial concerns, particularly for those showing high consumption levels. In the case of food industry buildings, energy is mainly used for indoor microclimate control, which is needed to ensure workers’ wellbeing and the most favourable conditions for food processing and conservation. To this end, it is important to have tools and methods allowing for easy, rapid and precise energy performance assessment of agri-food buildings. The accuracy of the results obtainable from the currently available computational models depends on the grade of detail and information used in constructional and geometric modelling. Moreover, this phase is probably the most critical and time-consuming in the energy diagnosis. In this context, fine surveying and advanced 3D geometric modelling procedures can facilitate building modelling and allow technicians and professionals in the agri-food sector to use highly efficient and accurate energy analysis and evaluation models. This paper proposes a dedicated model for energy performance assessment in agri-food buildings. It also shows that by using advanced surveying techniques, such as a terrestrial laser scanner and an infrared camera, it is possible to create a three-dimensional parametric model, while, thanks to the heat flow meter measurement method, it is also possible to obtain a thermophysical model. This model allows assessing the energy performance of agri-food buildings in order to improve the indoor microclimate control and the conditions of food processing and conservation. © F.

AB  - There is an urgent need for energy efficiency in buildings within the European framework, considering its environmental implications, and Europe's energy dependence. Furthermore, the need for enhancing and increasing productivity in the building industry turns new technologies and building energy performance simulation environments into extremely interesting solutions towards rigorous analysis and decision making in renovation within acceptable risk levels. The present work describes a multidisciplinary approach for the estimation of the energy performance of an educational building. The research involved data acquisition with advanced geomatic tools, the development of an optimized building information model, and energy assessment in Building Performance Simulation (BPS) software. Interoperability issues were observed in the different steps of the process. The inspection and diagnostic phases were conducted in a timely, accurate manner thanks to automated data acquisition and subsequent analysis using Building Information Modeling based tools (BIM-based tools). Energy simulation was performed using Design Builder, and the results obtained were compared with those yielded by the official software tool established by Spanish regulations for energy certification. The discrepancies between the results of both programs have proven that the official software program is conservative in this sense. This may cause the depreciation of the assessed buildings. © 2017 by the authors. Licensee MDPI.

This study demonstrates, through investigations of small samples of dwellings, that the level of quality, and outputs, from a standardised energy assessment can be variable. Multiple assessors evaluating the same property can produce quite markedly different results and, therefore, recommendations for what that household should do to reduce their energy consumption. Using the results of studies conducted by the authors and from elsewhere, qualified commentary is provided relating to what this form of energy assessment should be used for, and whether improvements can be made in the future as areas of policy look to reflect the recorded energy performance of dwellings through a range of policy vehicles. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This article focuses on the modeling of nonlinear interactions between the design and operational variables of a system and the multivariate outside environment in predicting the system’s performance. We propose a Sparse Partitioned-Regression (SPR) model that automatically searches for a partition of the environmental variables and fits a sparse regression within each subdivision of the partition, in order to fulfill an optimal criterion. Two optimal criteria are proposed, a penalized and a held-out criterion. We study the theoretical properties of SPR by deriving oracle inequalities to quantify the risks of the penalized and held-out criteria in both prediction and classification problems. An efficient recursive partition algorithm is developed for model estimation. Extensive simulation experiments are conducted to demonstrate the better performance of SPR compared with competing methods. Finally, we present an application of using building design and operational variables, outdoor environmental variables, and their interactions to predict energy consumption based on the Department of Energy’s Energy Plus data sets. SPR produces a high level of prediction accuracy. The result of the application also provides insights into the design, operation, and management of energy-efficient buildings. © 2017 “IISE”.

AB  - Purpose - Green Star is becoming a broadly accepted mark of design quality and environmental sustainability. Compared to other green tools, Green Star is considered as one of main streams green assessment tools, which cover almost sustainable criteria. Simultaneously, building information modelling (BIM) has also been introduced into the industry. BIM is expected to aid designers to shift the construction industry towards more environmentally and economically sustainable construction practice. Whilst the aspirations of Green Star rating and BIM implementation are broadly aligned, in the context of New Zealand this has led to some disconnects in design strategy and process. The purpose of this paper is to improve the practicality of BIM implementations for delivering Green Star certification in New Zealand. Design/methodology/approach - The extensive literature review is conducted through a series of incremental steps. A conceptual framework focussing on the relationship between benefits and challenges of BIM and Green Star is then developed. Findings - BIM supports practitioners to achieve the majority of Green Star criteria (75 per cent). Energy efficiency criterion is the key factor affecting the assessment process of Green Star and National Australian Built Environment Rating System in New Zealand. Research questions about lessening the challenges which can be encountered during the BIM and Green Star implementation are developed. Research limitations/implications - This paper is limited to a conceptual research. Further empirical research should be conducted to validate and modify the conceptual framework and the propositions presented in this paper to provide an initial insight into BIM and Green Star connectivity within the context of New Zealand. Originality/value - This paper provided a clear picture for investors, developers, practitioners about benefits and challenges of BIM and Green Star implementation. The outcomes are anticipated to deliver visions for shifting the country further towards development of sustainable future cities. © Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Many studies have highlighted the importance of retrofitting to mitigate the energy use of building stocks. An important step in the development of renovation strategy and energy conservation advising is to gather information of the energy performance of the existing buildings. However, renovation strategies must also consider the socio-economic challenges associated with the cost of energy retrofitting. This paper describes the development of an energy atlas of the multifamily building stock in Sweden for visualizing and analyzing energy use and renovation needs. The atlas has been developed using Extract Transform and Load technology (ETL) to aggregate information on the energy performance, building ownership, renovation status, and socio-economic status of inhabitants from various data sources. The atlas can visualize the energy use and renovation status of multifamily buildings in 2D maps and 3D models, displaying data for either individual buildings or aggregated data on spatial scales ranging from 250 × 250 m squares through district and municipality to county areas. A demonstration of its use on national and city scales indicates that energy retrofits of multifamily buildings reaching a service life of 50 years can reduce the energy use of the existing building stock by up to 50% relative to 1990. However, costs associated with renovation and energy retrofits of multifamily buildings can be problematic, especially in economically weak suburbs. A good understanding of past and future renovation needs and socio-economic consequences is important in the development of a sustainable national renovation strategy. © 2017

TI  - Assessing the value of information in residential building simulation: Comparing simulated and actual building loads at the circuit level

AB  - Building energy simulation tools are now being used in a number of new roles such as building operation optimization, performance verification for efficiency programs, and – recently – building energy code analysis, design, and compliance verification in the residential sector. But increasing numbers of studies show major differences between the results of these simulations and the actual measured performance of the buildings they are intended to model. The accuracy and calibration of building simulations have been studied extensively in the commercial sector, but these new applications have created a need to better understand the performance of home energy simulations. In this paper, we assess the ability of the DOE's EnergyPlus software to simulate the energy consumption of 106 homes using audit records, homeowner survey records, and occupancy estimates taken from monitored data. We compare the results of these simulations to device-level monitored data from the actual homes to provide a first measure of the accuracy of the EnergyPlus condensing unit, central air supply fan, and other energy consumption model estimates in a large number of homes. We then conduct sensitivity analysis to observe which physical and behavioral characteristics of the homes and homeowners most influence the accuracy of the modeling. Results show that EnergyPlus models do not accurately or consistently estimate occupied whole-home energy consumption. While some models accurately predict annual energy consumption to within 1% of measured data, none of the modeled homes meet ASHRAE criteria for a calibrated model when looking at hourly interval data. The majority of this error is due to appliance and lighting energy overestimates, followed by AC condensing unit use. These inaccuracies are due to factors such as occupant behaviors and differences in appliance and lighting stocks which are not well-captured in traditional energy audit reports. We identify a number of factors which must be specified for an accurate model, and others where using a default value will produce a similar result. The use of building simulation tools reflects a shift from a component-focused approach to a systems approach to residential code analysis and compliance verification that will serve to better identify and deploy efficiency measures in homes. By better understanding the limitations of home energy simulations and adopting strategies to mitigate the effects of model errors, simulation models can serve as valuable decision making tools in the residential sector. © 2017 The Authors

A sustainable building is constructed using the materials which can reduce the Environmental impacts, increase the Energy savings. Building Information Modeling proved effective in thermal analysis of a building virtually during the design stage. The main aim of the project was to assess the various combinations of materials using BIM tool and to show the difference in Electricity consumption and CO2 emissions while using the conventional materials and the Green certified materials. The amount of Electricity consumed and CO2emitted by a small residential building in Tiruchchirappalli, Tamilnadu, India were evaluated using Revit Architecture 2015 and Integrated Environment Systems VE software. The evaluation was done to show which materials helped in giving a better annual energy performance of the building and their comparison. At the end, alternative materials available for sustainable construction and the rating systems available for small residential constructions in India, material weightage in rating systems are analyzed. © IAEME Publication.

In particular, the highly dynamic nature of generation and consumption demands for a better utilization of energy resources, which seen the cost of storage infrastructure, can only be achieved through demand-response. Accordingly, the availability of energy and potential overload situations can be reflected using a price signal. The effectiveness of this mechanism arises from the flexibility of device operation, which is nevertheless heavily reliant on the exchange of information between the grid and its consumers. In this paper, we investigate the capability of an interactive energy management system to timely inform users on energy usage, in order to promote an optimal use of local resources. In particular, we analyze data being collected in several households in Italy and Austria to gain insights into usage behavior and drive the design of more effective systems. The outcome is the formulation of energy efficiency policies for residential buildings, as well as the design of an energy management system, consisting of hardware measurement units and a management software. The Mjölnir framework, which we release for open use, provides a platform where various feedback concepts can be implemented and assessed. This includes widgets displaying disaggregated and aggregated consumption information, as well as daily production and tailored advices. The formulated policies were implemented as an advisor widget able to autonomously analyze usage and provide tailored energy feedback. The advisor is estimated leading to a potential of 34% of savings using measurement data from the GREEND dataset. © 2017 - IOS Press and the authors. All rights reserved.

AB  - Models for hourly consumption of heat and electricity in different consumer groups on a regional level can yield important data for energy system planning and management. In this study hourly meter data, combined with cross-sectional data derived from the Norwegian energy label database, is used to model hourly consumption of both district heat and electrical energy in office buildings and schools which either use direct electric heating (DEH) or non-electric hydronic heating (OHH). The results of the study show that modeled hourly total energy consumption in buildings with DEH and in buildings with OHH (supplied by district heat) exhibits differences, e.g. due to differences in heat distribution and control systems. In a normal year, in office buildings with OHH the main part of total modeled energy consumption is used for electric appliances, while in schools with OHH the main part is used for heating. In buildings with OHH the share of modeled annual heating energy is higher than in buildings with DEH. Although based on small samples our regression results indicate that the presented method can be used for modeling hourly energy consumption in non-residential buildings, but also that larger samples and additional cross-sectional information could yield improved models and more reliable results. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - There is increasing interest in sustainable design for saving energy and improving living conditions. In particular, condensation performance evaluation is a major part of the design phase in which condensation defects in apartment housing are considered. The aim of this work is to propose an advanced process for improving the efficiency and accuracy of evaluations of condensation performance. For this aim, an analysis of the traditional process was performed. The results support a proposed advanced evaluation process, which was then applied to develop a building information modeling (BIM) application. The proposed process can be an alternative to the current evaluation process through the use of a BIM application for the automatic process. A case study showed that the advanced process of condensation performance evaluation could save 75.8% of the time compared with the current process. Additionally, from interviews with professionals, it is expected that the proposed process offers a practical means of increasing the efficiency and accuracy of the whole evaluation process. © 2017 Jooyung Hong et al.

AB  - Urban Building Energy Modeling (UBEM) is an emerging method for exploring energy efficiency solutions at urban or district scales. More versatile than statistical models, physical bottom-up UBEMs allow planners to quantitatively assess retrofit strategies and energy supply options, leading to more effective policies and management of energy demand. The most common approach for formulating an UBEM involves segmenting a building stock into archetypes, characterizing each type, and validating the model by comparing its output to aggregated measured energy consumption. This paper presents a more detailed methodology for setting up UBEMs while faced with incomplete information about the buildings. The procedure calls for defining unknown or uncertain parameters in archetype descriptions as probability distributions and, if available, using measured energy data to update these distributions by Bayesian calibration. The methodology is validated on residential houses in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Distributions for uncertain parameters are initially generated using a training set of 399 homes with monthly electricity and gas consumption records and then applied to a larger test set of 2263 homes. The procedure is applied both for monthly and annual metered energy usage data. Results show that both annual and monthly Bayesian calibration lead to significantly better annual energy use intensity (EUI) fits compared to traditional deterministic archetype definitions. As expected, an UBEM calibrated with monthly metered data more truthfully mimics monthly EUI distributions than one based on annual data, revealing the benefit of calibrating UBEMs using the smallest measurement time step available. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - An energy efficiency focused semantic information model for manufactured assemblies
PY  - 2017
AU  - Borsato, M.
AB  - Environmental Sustainability is one of the ‘Grand Challenges’ for manufacturing success in the 21st century. The present article mainly focuses on energy use during the manufacturing steps used for assembling products. In particular, industry still needs systematic and reliable ways to capture information for ultimately accounting for energy efficiency in manufacturing processes. For that purpose, an information model in the form of a formal ontology was created using information elements as building blocks, which emerge from manufacturing process models, supply chain operations, manufacturing process parameters, 3D form features and exergy-based thermodynamic analysis. These information elements were integrated by means of semantic relationships in an ontology. Once this information model was constructed, an application example of a welded hull panel assembly was used for verification of the model's representativeness and completeness. Results show that it is feasible to correlate all required data by means of semantic relationships for estimating energy efficiency indicators prior to physical prototyping, or ultimately comparing different alternatives for manufacturing processes regarding energy efficiency. However, manufacturing processes must be described in detail in order to allow energy efficiency analyses. In addition, geometric models need to be able to represent form features that can best relate to specific manufacturing process parameters. And finally, energy efficiency indicators, such as the degree-of-perfection can be derived from a comprehensive thermodynamic analysis, to be performed in each individual process step. Results indicate it is possible to provide an information structure for the calculation of the degree-of- perfection associated with an exergy-based thermodynamic analysis in assembly processes. Therefore, it has the potential to serve as a basis for a unifying framework for developing software applications that could allow the calculation of the degree of perfection in manufacturing operations. In addition, the resulting information model may facilitate data integration in the extended enterprise environment as well as the development of standards that can lead to seamless interoperability of manufacturing information systems. This paper presents the means by which energy efficiency can be accessed directly from an integrated semantic model, and opens the possibility to be extended for many different sorts of manufacturing processes. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - A study on building performance analysis for energy retrofit of existing industrial facilities

AU  - Gourlis, G.
AU  - Kovacic, I.
AB  - Due to the strengthening of regulations and codes on building energy performance, as well as with the application of national legislations regarding energy management and efficiency, existing industrial facilities are using thermal refurbishment and renovation as impetus for increasing their overall energy efficiency. This paper analyzes a building envelope refurbishment for a case study of an existing historical industrial facility. Critical parameters affecting energy performance of industrial buildings were identified by reviewing relevant literate. Two retrofit scenarios were developed and dynamic thermal simulation using EnergyPlus was implemented to evaluate the potential for improvement. Thereby the impact of interior loads was considered, determined by measurements conducted on factory machines, occupancy and lighting operation patterns. However, information regarding constructions of the existing facility and installed technical building services is limited. There is also uncertainty in the quantification of natural ventilation air change rate for such buildings. To overcome these limitations a study of various material databases was carried out, in order to assess data for building envelope composition. Input values for missing data were provided based on literature, allowing a fair comparison between refurbishment alternatives. Simulation results showed that the heating demand of the facility could be reduced up to 52%, indicating a significant potential for energy savings. Beyond that, thermal performance against summer overheating also depicted considerable improvements as regards to hours exceeding thermal comfort levels. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - City governments and energy utilities are increasingly focusing on the development of energy efficiency strategies for buildings as a key component in emission reduction plans and energy supply strategies. To support these diverse needs, a new generation of Urban Building Energy Models (UBEM) is currently being developed and validated to estimate citywide hourly energy demands at the building level. However, in order for cities to rely on UBEMs, effective model generation and maintenance workflows are needed based on existing urban data structures. Within this context, the authors collaborated with the Boston Redevelopment Authority to develop a citywide UBEM based on official GIS datasets and a custom building archetype library. Energy models for 83,541 buildings were generated and assigned one of 52 use/age archetypes, within the CAD modelling environment Rhinoceros3D. The buildings were then simulated using the US DOE EnergyPlus simulation program, and results for buildings of the same archetype were crosschecked against data from the US national energy consumption surveys. A district-level intervention combining photovoltaics with demand side management is presented to demonstrate the ability of UBEM to provide actionable information. Lack of widely available archetype templates and metered energy data, were identified as key barriers within existing workflows that may impede cities from effectively applying UBEM to guide energy policy. © 2016

AB  - The aim of the study is to present a developed bottom-up-based methodology for predicting the energy performance of residential stocks on the neighbourhood and city scales. This methodology enables predicting the energy demand and discomfort hours (heating and cooling) taking into account urban and building factors such as urban block type, street height-width ratio and solar orientation of the main façade, and shape factor and year of construction of the building, respectively. For this purpose, a four-staged methodology consisting in (1) urban taxonomy characterisation, (2) energy performance assessment, (3) statistical modelling and (4) stock aggregation is proposed, which combines building physical modelling and statistical inference in a Geographical Information System environment to provide an intuitive visual interface that represents final results on urban energy maps. The methodology was implemented in a medium-sized Spanish Mediterranean city as a case study, which allowed estimating the passive energy performance of a neighbourhood and setting building and urban design strategies. Results allowed concluding that the intrinsic parameters of the urban morphology play an important role on passive energy performance and important energy demand savings can be achieved when considering morphological urban aspects in new planning developments. This methodology is an efficient tool that can help stakeholders and local authorities in decision-making processes that focus both on developments of new urban areas taking into account energy requirements and on identifying and prioritising existing residential stocks in need of rehabilitation in energy terms. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In many urban contexts, energy systems are undergoing fundamental change towards more interconnected system layouts. Appropriate planning tools are necessary to guide this transition towards more energy efficient system designs. Thus, the aim of this paper is to present workflow automation approaches to model buildings and district energy systems for dynamic simulation and integral system analyses. For data collection and management, we use a Geographic Information System coupled with a PostgreSQL database. In this paper, we present the software tools TEASER and uesmodels which use this data to automatically generate dynamic building and district energy system models in the modeling language Modelica. To demonstrate the application of these tools for workflow automation, we analyze a university campus with 39 buildings. In one scenario, an optimization led to an improved heating curve, with which yearly primary energy demand in the model was reduced by 0.9%. In a second scenario, the retrofitting of all building envelopes in the district energy system reduced primary energy demand by 16.0%. These examples showed that the presented approach is suited to evaluate options for improving district energy system, ranging from improved operation to changes in system design, and a combination of both. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Background: Nowadays wind energy is becoming increasingly significant in the planning, development and growth of new electricity supply systems. Special attention has been given to land-based turbines for ensuring the efficient economical operation of massive hubs rising 100m above the ground, based on the idea that the bigger the turbine, the more complicated are the transportation and assembly processes. Methods: A new design of a wind turbine has several advantages compared to conventional designs; one of these advantages lies in the use of prefabricated elements, which increases efficiency. The implementation of information technology as a complement to prefabrication techniques is a further aim of this research, which seeks to improve the overall performance of the project. Consequently, Building Information Modelling is suggested as the most suitable methodology for complementing off-site techniques and reaching higher efficiency by improving design, manufacture, transportation and assembly processes. Results: This paper will present the research project “hybrid² tower for wind turbines” funded by the State of Hesse, Germany, which focuses on a new, efficient and economical design for high wind turbine towers. The new hybrid² tower is composed of a concrete tower containing prefabricated concrete quarter-circle elements, steel beams and a steel tube tower on the top. The combination of concrete and steel beams improves the static and dynamic performance of the main supporting structure. With this new design, the weight of the concrete tower is estimated to decrease by 40 % compared to a traditional full-concrete tower and, as a positive consequence, the cost of assembly (including assembly on site) is reduced. Conclusions: Due to the energy revolution, a special focus is put on the development of renewable energies, especially wind power. The steadily increasing hub heights of wind turbines means that tower structures have to be more massive. The development of the hybrid² tower by using Building Information Modeling and prefabrication techniques leads to an optimized performance and reduces transport and assembly costs. © 2016, Alvarez-Anton et al.

AB  - Energy efficiency is a critical element of building energy conservation. Energy Information Administration (EIA) and International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) estimated that over 6% of electrical energy was lost during transmission and distribution. Sensing and tracking technologies, and data-mining offer new windows to better understanding these losses in real-time. Recent developments in energy optimization computational methods also allow engineers to better characterize energy consumption load profiles. The paper focuses on developing new and robust data-mining techniques to explore large and complex data generated by sensing and tracking technologies. These techniques would potentially offer new avenues to understand and prevent energy losses during transmission. The paper presents two new concepts: First, a set of clustering algorithms that model the supply-demand characterization of four different substations clusters, and second, a semi-supervised machine learning and clustering technique are developed to optimize the losses and automate the process of identifying loss factors contributing to the total loss. This three-step process uses real-time data from buildings and the substations that supply electricity to the buildings to develop the proposed technique. The preliminary findings of this paper help the utility service providers to understand the energy supply-demand requirements. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The simultaneous heat and moisture transfer in the building envelope has an important influence on the indoor climate and the overall thermal performance of buildings. In this work, the development of a Building Energy Analysis Model (BEAM) predicting whole building heat and moisture transfer is presented. The coupled heat and moisture transfer model takes into account most of the main hygrothermal effects in buildings. The coupled system model is implemented in Matlab, and verified with EnergyPlus. Furthermore, BEAM is reduced via a physically based model order reduction to a lower order system model (Re-BEAM) to be easily integrated with a control algorithm. By utilizing Re-BEAM, a Model-Based Predictive Control (MBPC) method is developed to incorporate critical building information into control algorithms, such that the building energy consumption is minimized while comfort conditions are maintained. The resulting optimal setpoint schedule can be applied on any HVAC system. Simulation results of a building structure demonstrate the superiority in terms of energy and peak load reductions compared with traditional constant control methods and control methods that use a occupants-varying temperature schedule. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - More than one-third of the energy demand of industrialised countries is due to achieving acceptable conditions of thermal comfort and lighting in buildings. Energy demand in buildings depends on a combination of several parameters, such as climate, envelope typologies, occupant behaviour, and intended use. Indeed, assessing a building's energy performance requires substantial input data describing constructions, environmental conditions, envelope thermo-physical properties, geometry, control strategies, and several other parameters. This has been a very active area of research in recent years, and several numerical approaches have been developed for building simulation; furthermore, most of these approaches have been tested and implemented in specialised software tools. However, the use of these tools poses many challenges in regards to the retrieval of reliable and detailed information, setting a steep learning curve for engineers and energy managers. It is often more convenient to have a simplified model that allows the evaluation of energy demand with a good level of accuracy and without excessive computational costs or user expertise. In this work, the authors extrapolate a set of simple correlations to permit a fast preliminary assessment of heating energy demand for office buildings. Data employed to build the correlations come from detailed dynamic simulations performed in TRNSYS environment. The models were built according to the standards and laws of building energy requirements in seven different European countries. For a more general assessment, the authors identified three cities for each country; for each location, three models with different shape factors were considered (S/V = 0.24, 0.5 and 0.9). The results obtained from the simulations allowed for the determination of direct correlations among the thermal energy demand for space heating HDD and S/V values. In this way, the authors provided simple equations for a reliable and easy-to-use preliminary assessment of the energy demand of non-residential buildings to planners and designers, taking into account regulation dictated by law in each considered country. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This work explores the application of a real-time monitoring system to achieve optimal indoor environmental quality (IEQ). It focuses on information and communication technology (ICT) applications and building information modeling (BIM) through a case study from an architect point of view. ICT-related applications have drawn attention from smart buildings as potential means of providing correlations between users and building systems to improve energy efficiency and comfort. This work attempts to present the main progress in the fields of energy efficiency and energy management strategies through a cost-effective ICT application. In order to investigate whether users can take advantage of natural environmental factors during occupied hours in office buildings, daylight and energy performance simulations were carried out. This work explores users as the primary factors to improve indoor environmental quality (IEQ) and energy efficiency. The results support the use of real-time monitoring systems in office buildings. It seems, however, that there is a need for individual user control of thermal, ventilation, and lighting. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Energy performance assessments (EPAs) are widely conducted on buildings, which consume considerable energy and emit a significant amount of greenhouse gases. However, manual-based traditional EPA methods can cause serious problems, such as recurrent and error-prone data replication, data leaks, and redundant data processing and storage. Building information modeling (BIM), as an integrated repository of information about a particular building, has been applied to EPAs to overcome those problems. Although BIM has the potential to increase work efficiency in the assessment process, low interoperability between BIM data and energy simulation models raises huge barriers to reliable BIM-based EPAs. This research aims to improve the interoperability of BIM-based EPAs by developing an environment that contains a process, a materials library, and an EPA support system that connects BIM and energy modeling. To validate the suggested environment, we conducted a case study, and the results show that the proposed environment greatly contributes to increased accuracy and efficiency in the EPA with high interoperability. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The focus of this paper is to examine the energy efficiency measures that are currently applied in this sector and their effects on the energy performance. The information necessary for the research is drawn from a monitoring system that contains data about the physical state and the energy performance of more than 1.5 million dwellings in the sector. The method followed is based on the statistical modeling and data analysis of physical properties regarding energy efficiency, general dwellings’ characteristics and energy performance of 757,614 households. The outcomes of this research provide insight in the energy efficiency measures applied to the existing residential stock. Most of the changes regard the heating and domestic hot water (DHW) systems, and the glazing. The rest of the building envelope elements are not improved at the same frequency. The results show that the goals for this sector will be hard to achieve if the same strategy for renovation is followed. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This paper elaborates the formulation and application of an integral methodology for overall energy performance improvement of office buildings and demonstrates its application. The developed multi-objective methodology is demonstrated on a reference office building located in a temperate climate zone with high annual temperature variations. The idea is to formulate a research based proposition in building science with a formulation of a general/integral methodology which could be applied widely in energy performance refurbishment of existing office buildings and help architects and engineers in the early-design stages of new projects. The goal was to formulate an optimized building envelope model using multi-criterion optimization methodology in order to determine efficient window to wall ratio (WWR) and window geometry (WG) in the function of indoor illumination quality, followed by the assessment of glazing parameters influence on the annual energy demand. The integral methodology for overall energy performance improvement of office buildings utilizes multi-criterion optimization method and highly detailed Building Information Modeling (BIM) programs and dynamic energy simulation engines. The developed coupled-integral methodology links together both building envelope construction optimization and user comfort. The methodology is both flexible and adaptable for application in various climatic conditions and for different construction types. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Modelling long-term HFC emissions from India's residential air-conditioning sector: exploring implications of alternative refrigerants, best practices, and a sustainable lifestyle within an integrated assessment modelling framework
PY  - 2016
AU  - Chaturvedi, V.

AB  - India's growing role in the global climate debate makes it imperative to analyse emission reduction policies and strategies across a range of GHGs, especially for under-researched non-CO2 gases. Hydrofluorocarbons' (HFCs) usage in cooling equipment and subsequent emissions are expected to increase dramatically in India with the phase-out of hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) as coolants in air-conditioning equipment. We focus on the residential air-conditioning sector in India and analyse a suite of HFC and alternative coolant gas scenarios for understanding the implications for GHG emissions from this sector within an integrated assessment modelling framework. We find that, if unabated, HFC410A emissions will contribute to 36% of the total global warming impact from the residential air-conditioner sector in India in 2050, irrespective of the future economic growth trajectory, and the remaining 64% is from energy to power residential air-conditioners. A move towards more efficient, low global warming potential (GWP) alternative refrigerants will significantly reduce the cumulative global warming footprint of this sector by 37% during the period 2010–2050, due to gains both from energy efficiency as well as low GWP alternatives. Best practices for reducing direct emissions are important, but only of limited utility, and if a sustainable lifestyle is adopted by consumers with lower floorspace, low GWP refrigerants, and higher building envelope efficiencies, cumulative emissions during 2010–2050 can be reduced by 46% compared to the Reference scenario. Policy relevance Our analysis has important implications for Indian climate policy. We highlight that the Indian government's amendment proposal to the Montreal Protocol is a strong signal to the Indian market that the transition away from high GWP refrigerants towards low/zero GWP alternatives will happen sooner or later. The Bureau of Energy Efficiency should extend building energy conservation code policy to residential buildings immediately, and the government should mandate it. Government authorities should set guidelines and mandate reporting of data related to air-conditioner coolant recharge frequency and recovery of scrapped air-conditioner units. For contentious issues like flammability where there is no consensus within the industry, the government needs to undertake an independent technical assessment that can provide unbiased and reliable information to the market. © 2015 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - During the previous two decades, the energy saving potential using systematic building management is considered to be important which should be considered through the building lifecycle. Among the wide range types of different buildings, Public buildings are considered as one of the biggest energy-consuming sector in the world and major part of this amount is used by the air conditioning system especially in tropical climates. The most effective decisions related to sustainable design of a building facility are made in the feasibility and early design stages. Building Information Modeling (BIM) can expedite this process and provide the opportunity of testing and assessing different design alternatives and materials selection that may impact on energy performance of buildings. This paper aims at evaluating the efficiency of various types of wall materials with regard to theirs properties on energy saving. The case study in this paper is modeled by means of BIM application and then simulated by software, which is appropriate for energy analysis. The current energy consumption patterns of this case identified and shifted to the optimized level of energy usages by changing the walls materials to find most optimized of walls materials. Modification most optimized wall materials and energy analysis indicated 9347 Wh in Per meter square of electrical energy saving. © 2016, Penerbit UTM Press. All rights reserved.

AB  - In response to rising energy costs and the impetus to reduce environmental impacts, upgrading the large building stock that is responsible for 40% of the total energy consumption to maximum energy efficiency is becoming an important task. Despite the many benefits associated with retrofit projects, they are still only slowly being implemented because of the many challenges that exist. One of these challenges is optimizing the decision between renovation scenarios based on economic and environmental goals, which can be made possible with an accurate pre-retrofit model. The intention of this paper is to introduce a pre-retrofit model that efficiently obtains and integrates multiple forms of building data as a critical step to develop a comprehensive understanding of a building to be renovated. Opportunities for utilizing building information modeling (BIM) and geographical information systems (GIS) for retrofitting projects were explored through the study of a historical campus building. With the use of as-is geometric data and as-is data, building data maps were obtained. The next step of this study is to use the model to conduct scenarios comparison and optimize renovation decision based on economic and environmental goals. © 2016, Tsinghua University Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

In particular, the equations of the model accurately fit recorded data of temperature, relative humidity and carbon dioxide concentration in different workplaces. For validation, data were obtained under different conditions and with different sensors. In particular, we designed and fabricated a wireless sensor that measures and transmits data to a remote device and we also applied our model to data collected using a commercial sensor. For each case, information was obtained that could be used to understand and predict the evolution of ambient variables that impact thermal comfort and energy consumption in buildings. The tools presented here can thus be of great interest to achieve affordable, smart energy-efficient buildings, while adhering to environmental laws and comfort for work spaces. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Different optimization methods generate a large variety of solutions that are suitable for achieving the sets of chosen objectives. The selection of appropriate design variables and objective functions are essential elements in the optimization process. However, the existing methodologies seem to be too complicated and designers seek to use simplified methods in order to evaluate the overall performance of the buildings. The advancement of information technology enables the use of Building Information Modelling and energy simulation tools for the integrated building design in an early stage. Thus, this article introduces a new evaluation method for analysis of the effective solution of the building performance and aims at determining the influence of a complex criteria (construction duration, construction cost, annual bill-based costs, annual primary energy demand, annual CO2 emissions of energy use, CO2 emissions of construction materials and works, thermal comfort) for the final decision making. The findings of the article have confirmed that the high level of the building energy efficiency is not directly proportional to the overall investments, i.e. additional investments do not bring benefits from economic and environmental points of view. © 2016 Vilnius Gediminas Technical University (VGTU) Press.

AB  - This research aims at demonstrating techniques in complex dynamic building energy simulation methods that greatly reduce the otherwise very time-consuming - in particular cases even week-long - computation time of simulation models, however marginal difference arises in the energy results of the simulations. Different test simulations were created to examine how to simplify the models without altering the energy and comfort results, which lead to reduce also the working hours spent on building the model. The building physics behavior of the zones, heating and cooling equipment in the complex model were studied and tested to understand how those can be used, merged or simplified in order to speed up both computation time and model building phase. The IDA ICE complex dynamic building energy simulation program offers two methods - periodic and dynamic - for calculation, which were compared in this program. Test simulations provide information about possible differences between the results of these calculation methods, in order to define the appropriate use of these methods. © 2016 Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest.

AB  - Energy consumption in buildings is a key factor when accomplishing national and global CO2 emission goals. The economic savings per building are limited and are difficult to argue. However, the efforts can be aggregated on district or city level: the approach described in this paper is a large scale co-simulation environment that helps to leverage efficiency by providing quantitative information about the efficiency impact on large scale, while minimizing the efforts in modeling single buildings. It addresses the challenge of modeling thermal behavior of a large neighborhood of buildings in order to calculate energy demands, regarding weather conditions, shading and room temperature settings with a time resolution below one hour. A proof of concept applies the method to a demonstration site of residential buildings and shows the heating demand and CO2 footprint of the neighborhood. © 2016 The Authors.

AB  - The building industry and facility management is in a state of upheaval: The complexity of the real world is now represented in its digital counterpart. The established object-based file format “Industrial Foundation Classes (IFC)” developed by the International Alliance for Interoperability facilitates interoperability in the context of Building Information Modeling. Unfortunately, there is no feasible workflow for filtering energy-related information, e.g. a streamlined version of the building geometry. Simplification methods often fail on CAD data that is ignorant of domain specific semantic information (i.e. functional differences between a door and stucco are not reflected in the geometry and are therefore often ignored). With EU law now requiring energy performance certificates to be issued for all buildings, energy performance analysis becomes an increasingly important topic. Accurate, yet efficient calculation depends on simple building models. However, typical IFC models contain a lot of irrelevant data, in particular geometric representations, which are too detailed for energy performance analysis. Therefore, we propose an algorithm that extracts input models suitable for calculations directly from IFC models in a semi-automatic process. The key aspect of the algorithm is geometry simplification subject to semantic and functional groups; more specifically, the 3D representations of walls, slabs, windows, doors, etc. are reduced to a collection of surfaces describing the building’s thermal shell on one hand, and the material layers associated with it on the other hand. This simplification takes into account semantic constraints and expert knowledge. Furthermore, it works on “real-world” data; i.e. it is robust towards incomplete, imperfect and inconsistent data. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - University campuses can be considered as small towns due to their size, number of users and mixed and complex activities, including numerous actions usually met in urban environments. The energy and environmental impact of universities could be considerably reduced by applying organizational, technological and energy optimization measures. The aim of the present paper is to present an efficient web based energy management system for Campuses which manages in an energy efficient way the Campus buildings and spaces of public use, monitors the energy load and performs energy analysis per building and for the Campus as a whole, as well as it interacts with each building's BEMS and each user through questionnaires, e-mails and forms. The existing Campus IP infrastructure is exploited by using sensor networks, where nodes communicate their information using Web services, allowing direct integration in modern IT systems. To guarantee the system scalability and respect consolidated and diffused standards, the logical/architectural level of the whole Campus Energy Management System is linked with the existing infrastructure based on Internet Protocol (IP). The overall installation is tested via on line questionnaires to the building users showing a significant increase of the occupants' satisfaction. Finally, the energy efficiency achieved by the proposed system is almost 20%. © 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Accurate weather information is required to assess the performance of sustainable buildings. Currently such performance is assessed using Typical Meteorological Year (TMY) weather files. TMY3 is the latest TMY file introduced by Department of Energy (DOE) and it represents the historical 30-year average of weather data more closely than any other available datasets. However, TMY3 data reflects the past and do not accurately forecast weather information thus leading to erroneous estimation of performance and economic feasibility. Therefore, more accurate methods are necessary to generate weather files so as to design buildings for sustainability and resilience. This article proposes an effective hybrid modeling methodology based on support vector machine regression and probability estimation to predict long term future weather variables. The methodology has been validated by using a dataset containing historical solar irradiance data for 54 years (1961-2014) for Cincinnati, Ohio. By implementing the proposed technique multiple models were trained with different segments of the dataset, which were used to predict the hourly solar irradiance for 8, 9, 10 and 11 years respectively. Subsequently, the predicted data and the current TMY3 data was compared with the actual historical data. The average increase in accuracy of the predicted over TMY3 direct normal and diffuse horizontal components of solar irradiance was found to be 38.43% and 11.8%. These findings suggest that the long term accuracy of the proposed modeling technique is greater than the current state-of-the-art. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Sensor node placement optimization has a significant role in wireless sensor networks, especially in structural health monitoring. Since sensor node placement affects the routing, optimization should be Jointly done for the node placement and routing. The existing work separately optimizes the node placement and routing (by performing routing after carrying out the node placement). However, this approach does not guarantee the optimality of the overall solution. In this paper, joint optimization of sensor placement, routing, and flow assignment is introduced and solved using mixed integer programming modeling. Finding an optimal solution for this joint problem is too complex. Hence, a near-optimal solution is obtained using genetic algorithms with reduced complexity. In addition, a heuristic algorithm for joint routing and flow assignment with placement is proposed using the effective independence model, which optimizes the information quality and energy consumption for efficient communication. Lastly, results are presented in a nine-floor building to compare the three proposed algorithms with the heuristic algorithm by Li et al. The numerical results show the efficiency of the proposed algorithms and the tradeoff between the efficiency and the complexity. © 2001-2012 IEEE.

AB  - In recent years, building energy consumption has increased in response to climate change, resulting in a worldwide reduction of energy efficiency. A strong response is required, through both the enhancement of building energy efficiency and the reduction of power usage. These objectives could be achieved by pursuing “Blackout” prevention, through developing a control unit such as that of the urban energy grid system that was used in the Energy Operation Center (EOC) for smart cities. In this context, this paper presents an optimization operation technique for Building Energy Management Systems (BEMS), using control monitor-based Building Information Modeling (BIM) for the efficient operation of the EOC. BIM is one of the approaches that can be used for the visual representation, management, and exchange of information on all aspects of a building. The EOC should be able to efficiently represent the data from the building information, and the operator maintaining it should be able to promptly acquire the data for handling it. This suggests that the control of energy consumption by a Building Automation System (BAS) to maximize building energy efficiency will lead to improved total energy performance, reduced operating costs, and reduced environmental impact. © 2016, Korean Society for Precision Engineering and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Energy rehabilitation actions in buildings have become a great economic opportunity for the construction sector. They also constitute a strategic goal in the European Union (EU), given the energy dependence and the compromises with climate change of its member states. About 75% of existing buildings in the EU were built when energy efficiency codes had not been developed. Approximately 75% to 90% of those standing buildings are expected to remain in use in 2050. Significant advances have been achieved in energy analysis, simulation tools, and computer fluid dynamics for building energy evaluation. However, the gap between predictions and real savings might still be improved. Geomatics and computer science disciplines can really help in modelling, inspection, and diagnosis procedures. This paper presents a multi-sensor acquisition system capable of automatically and simultaneously capturing the three-dimensional geometric information, thermographic, optical, and panoramic images, ambient temperature map, relative humidity map, and light level map. The system integrates a navigation system based on a Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) approach that allows georeferencing every data to its position in the building. The described equipment optimizes the energy inspection and diagnosis steps and facilitates the energy modelling of the building. © 2016 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Several building-stock modelling techniques have been employed to investigate the impact of energy efficiency measures (EEM), where the description of the building-stock generally consists of an age-type classification to specify building characteristics for groups of buildings. Such descriptions lack the appropriate level of detail to differentiate the potential for EEM within age groups. This paper proposes a methodology for building-stock description using building-specific data and measured energy use to augment an age-type building-stock classification. By integrating building characteristics from energy performance certificates, measured energy use and envelope areas from a 2.5D GIS model, the building-stock description reflects the heterogeneity of the building-stock. The proposed method is validated using a local building portfolio (N = 433) in the city of Gothenburg, where modelled results for space heating and domestic hot water are compared to data from measurements, both on an individual building level and for the entire portfolio. Calculated energy use based on the building-stock description of the portfolio differ less than 3% from measured values, with 42% of the individual buildings being within a 20% margin of measured energy use indicating further work is needed to reduce or quantify the uncertainty on a building level. © 2016 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - As automatic sensing and information and communication technology get cheaper, building monitoring data becomes easier to obtain. The availability of data leads to new opportunities in the context of energy efficiency in buildings. This paper describes the development and validation of a data-driven grey-box modelling toolbox for buildings. The Python toolbox is based on a Modelica library with thermal building and Heating, Ventilation and Air-Conditioning models and the optimization framework in JModelica.org. The toolchain facilitates and automates the different steps in the system identification procedure, like data handling, model selection, parameter estimation and validation. To validate the methodology, different grey-box models are identified for a single-family dwelling with detailed monitoring data from two experiments. Validated models for forecasting and control can be identified. However, in one experiment the model performance is reduced, likely due to a poor information content in the identification data set. © 2015 International Building Performance Simulation Association (IBPSA).

TI  - Holistic approach to achieving low-energy, high-rise residential buildings

AB  - As codes and standards evolve toward low- or net zero-energy buildings, the practicality of achieving these targets in high-rise concrete construction gets increasingly challenging. High-rise residential buildings are becoming more common as cities redevelop and add density. Current design and construction practice for high-rise multi-unit residential buildings present a number of constraints with regard to achieving high levels of energy performance. These practice issues typically include (a) the desire to maximize glass to enhance marketability, daylight, and views; (b) the desire to provide access to the outdoors via extended balconies; (c) the need for Code-mandated non-combustibility and life safety requirements; (d) a preference for building systems that minimize exterior construction access and streamlines construction sequencing; (e) the adoption of increased structural load requirements; and/or (f) the drive to minimize initial capital costs. The outcome of these combined constraints is often poor energy efficiency, with the burden of higher operating costs deferred to future owners. There has been significant industry discussion on the poor energy performance of this class of building, but there is very little guidance or long-term factual strategic information beyond broad principles of minimizing glazing areas, maximizing glazing performance, increasing airtightness, and adding more insulation to opaque areas. This article explores the prospect of energy use becoming a primary consideration in high-rise residential buildings and what that will likely mean for the typical competing constraints mentioned earlier. This article utilizes the current common construction practices for concrete-framed, high-rise residential buildings in heating dominated climates (ASHRAE Zones 4 to 7) as a baseline to evaluate the impact of the interconnected variables related to reducing overall heating energy use. The objective is to weigh the impact of individual improvements against integrated bundles of measures to develop a roadmap and a better understanding of a practical path toward low-energy, high-rise residential buildings. The article focuses on solutions related to building envelope performance but from a holistic perspective that recognizes the interaction and contribution of mechanical systems typical of this construction type. The building envelope parameters covered includes glazing performance (for both conventional and innovative technologies) and opaque wall performance (with a focus on specific details to reduce thermal bridging rather than increasing insulation levels). The analysis presented draws upon three-dimensional thermal modeling, whole building energy analysis, field testing and monitoring, and typical construction costs. The goal is to develop realistic targets for high-rise buildings and identify improvements that can be arrived at by market forces rather than those that can only be realized through more stringent and enforceable codes and standards. © The Author(s) 2016.

AB  - Energy Efficient Building (EEB) design, construction, and operations require the development and sharing of building information among different individuals, organizations, and computer applications. The Representational State Transfer (RESTful) Building Information Modeling (BIM) web service is a solution to enable an effective exchange of data. This paper presents an investigation into the core RESTful web service requirements needed to effectively support the EEB project lifecycle. The requirements include information exchange requirements, distributed collaboration requirements, internal data storage requirements, and partial model query requirements. We also propose a RESTful web service design model on different abstraction layers to enhance the BIM lifecycle in energy efficient building design. We have implemented a RESTful Application Program Interface (API) prototype on a mock BIMserver to demonstrate our idea. We evaluate our design by conducting a user study based on the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM). The results show that our design can enhance the efficiency of data exchange in EEB design scenarios. © 2016 by the authors.

AB  - More than 44% of building energy consumption in the USA is used for space heating and cooling, and this accounts for 20% of national CO2 emissions. This prompts the need to identify among the 130 million households in the USA those with the greatest energy-saving potential and the associated costs of the path to reach that goal. Whereas current solutions address this problem by analysing each building in detail, we herein reduce the dimensionality of the problem by simplifying the calculations of energy losses in buildings. We present a novel inference method that can be used via a ranking algorithm that allows us to estimate the potential energy saving for heating purposes. To that end, we only need consumption from records of gas bills integrated with a building's footprint. The method entails a statistical screening of the intricate interplay between weather, infrastructural and residents' choice variables to determine building gas consumption and potential savings at a city scale. We derive a general statistical pattern of consumption in an urban settlement, reducing it to a set of the most influential buildings' parameters that operate locally. By way of example, the implications are explored using records of a set of (N-6200) buildings in Cambridge, MA, USA, which indicate that retrofitting only 16% of buildings entails a 40% reduction in gas consumption of the whole building stock. We find that the inferred heat loss rate of buildings exhibits a power-law data distribution akin to Zipf's law, which provides a means to map an optimum path for gas savings per retrofit at a city scale. These findings have implications for improving the thermal efficiency of cities' building stock, as outlined by current policy efforts seeking to reduce home heating and cooling energy consumption and lower associated greenhouse gas emissions. © 2016 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

AB  - Housing has long been thought to play a significant role in population exposure to environmental hazards such as high temperatures and air pollution. However, there is sparse data describing how housing may modify heat and air pollution exposure such that housing's role in poor health and mortality from these hazards may be estimated. This paper describes the development of individual-address level indoor overheating and air pollution risk modifiers for Great Britain, for use alongside historical weather, outdoor air pollution, population socio-economic data, and mortality data in a large-scale epidemiological investigation. A geographically-referenced housing stock database was developed using the Homes Energy Efficiency Database (HEED) and the English Housing Survey (EHS). Simulations of unique combinations of building, fabric, occupation, and environment were run using a modelling framework developed for EnergyPlus 8.0, estimating indoor temperature metrics, indoor/outdoor ratio of pollution from outdoor sources, and indoor air pollution from multiple indoor sources. Results were compiled, matched back to individual properties in HEED, and mapped using Geographical Information Systems (GIS). Results indicate urban areas had higher numbers of buildings prone to overheating, reduced levels indoor air pollution from outdoor sources, and higher air pollution from indoor sources relative to rural areas, driven largely by variations in building types. The results provide the first national-scale quantitative estimate of heat and indoor air pollution modification by dwellings, aggregated at levels suitable for inclusion in health analysis. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The overall energy efficiency of existing buildings has to be significantly improved to comply with emerging regulations and to contribute to overcoming current environmental challenges. Many policies aim at accelerating the renovation rate. The effectiveness of renovation actions could be significantly improved through the systematic use of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) tools and Building Information Modeling (BIM). But these solutions rely on full-fledged digital models, which, for most buildings, are not available. The present article introduces a research work aiming at the development of methods for the generation of 3D building models from 2D plans. The developed prototype is able to extract information from 2D plans and to generate IFC (Industry Foundation Classes)-compliant 3D models that include the main components of the building: walls, openings, and spaces. The article also presents the results of a quantitative assessment of the platform capabilities and performances, relying on a database of 90 real architectural floor plans. The results are very promising and show that such solutions could be key components of future digital toolkits for renovation design. © 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Building energy analysis has gained attention in recent years, as awareness for energy efficiency is rising in order to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. At the same time, the building information modeling paradigm is aiming to develop comprehensive digital representations of building characteristics based on semantic 3D models. Most of the data required for energy performance calculation can be found in such models; however, extracting the relevant data is not a trivial problem. This article presents an algorithm to prepare input data for energy analysis based on building information models. The crucial aspect is geometric simplification according to semantic constraints: the building element geometries are reduced to a set of surfaces representing the thermal shell as well as the internal boundaries. These boundary parts are then associated with material layers and thermally relevant data. The presented approach, previously discussed at the International Academic Conference on Places and Technologies (Ladenhauf et al., 2014), significantly reduces the needed time for energy analysis. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This paper describes the City Energy Analyst (CEA), a computational framework for the analysis and optimization of energy systems in neighborhoods and city districts. The framework allows analyzing the energy, carbon and financial benefits of multiple urban design scenarios in conjunction to optimal schemes of distributed generation. For this, the framework integrates time-dependent methods for building energy performance simulation, conversion and storage technologies simulation, assessment of local energy potentials, bi-level energy systems optimization and multi-criteria analysis. Based on past research, the framework introduces a novel interface to facilitate the spatiotemporal analysis of patterns of demand and potential infrastructure solutions. The model was programmed in Python v2.7 and built as an extension of the Geographic Information System ArcGIS v10.3, which serves as a platform for the allocation and future dissemination of spatiotemporal data. We present an application of the model for a downtown area in Switzerland where we evaluated four trajectories of development and found optimum infrastructure solutions for their operation. For a more holistic approach we used the 2000-W/1-t CO2 society vision concept to compare the environmental performance of these solutions with that of embodied energy in buildings and transportation systems. From the optimization process, most infrastructure solutions showed an average integration of 50% to 80% of buildings in thermal micro-grids, 50 to 100% of the available solar potential, and a resource mix consisting of photovoltaic electricity and sources of waste and ambient heat. For a balanced distribution of social, environmental and economic criteria, the results showed potential relative savings in the area from 45% to 60% in emissions and from 25% to 50% in primary energy at an annualized cost between 14% and 44% higher than today. For an economic-driven distribution, the results showed savings of up to 23% in emissions, 36% in primary energy and 11% in costs. We identified close to 15% in emissions and 20% in primary energy savings with variable costs between -2% and 23% in the area are strongly related to the urban design option rather than to its optimal energy system. In comparison to local benchmarks, the environmental impact of buildings during operation lies between that of embodied energy in buildings and mobility in the service sector (business flights). We estimated that an increase in close to 4% of today's average efficiency of photovoltaic technology would allow the area to comply with those local benchmarks. On the other hand, we concluded the suitability of the City Energy Analyst (CEA) to assist urban planning authorities looking for both design and engineering options to increase the performance of their neighborhoods and city districts. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Desiccant wheels have been extensively used for energy recovery of ventilation air from buildings. Performance of these wheels is influenced by many factors like the material properties, wheel matrix structures, operating conditions and fluid parameters. Previous studies only involved the macro-scale heat and mass transfer in the wheels and the system performance, by neglecting the micro-scale properties of wheel materials. In this study, a dual-scale modeling approach was proposed for a desiccant wheel with a novel organic-inorganic hybrid adsorbent (HA) material which combines high adsorption capability with good mechanical durability. The proposed dual-scale model included a micro-scale molecular dynamics (MD) sub-model for adsorbent material, a macro-scale sub-model for heat and mass transfer in matrix channels and system performance evaluation. The two sub-models were linked together through information exchange to form the dual-scale model. Through modeling, the effects of the micro physical-chemical properties of materials and macro structure of wheels, as well as the operating parameters on system performance were investigated. With the dual-scale model as a design tool, material compositions were optimized. The moisture adsorption capacity of the material was two times higher than that of silica gel B at high relative humidities. Consequently the sensible and latent effectiveness were improved by 12% and 30% respectively. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The article discusses the process of creating and using technical and economic models for optimization of pumping well stock, starting from the modeling of power consumption by the artifitial oil lift taking into account the main influencing factors, and ending with the construction of a general cost model of profitability of wells operation, allowing to define optimum modes of wells operation from the point of view of economic efficiency. We showed the main disadvantages of common approaches to the calculation of the target bottom-hole pressure based solely on geological and technical limitations, and provide a methodology for determining optimal modes of extraction wells on the criterion of maximization of economic efficiency. Building technikal and economic models is based on existing field information on the operation of the pumping well stock, estimation of the calculated and actual energy consumption. The main result is the final cost models of producing well operation. On the basis of these models the evaluation of the optimum operation of the production wells on the criterion of maximizing cash flow is made. The proposed method allows to determine the most cost-effective mode of operation (optimal bottom-hole pressure) for each pumping well and to maximize cash flow from the development of the field as a whole. It opens new possibilities for improving the efficiency of operation of high water-cut low-profit and unprofitable wells.

AB  - Open-loop groundwater geothermal heat pumps (GWHP) represent an interesting technology that is expected to contribute significantly to the reduction of primary energy use for buildings heating and cooling needs especially in urban context. In the GWHP's design phases the geological and hydrogeological parameters must be accurately determined in order to maximize efficiency and minimize installation costs. Physical properties of the aquifer such as the porosity and the thermal parameters of the aquifer framework have been usually obtained through field and laboratory geotechnical testing. Hydrogeological and hydraulic parameters of the exploited aquifer such as hydraulic conductivity and the storativity are usually obtained through pumping test. As reported in literature, the prevailing component of the heat transfer in the aquifer induced by the water re-injection is related to the advection and therefore the determination of the real field groundwater velocity in transient and steady conditions is fundamental in the modelling of the thermal plume especially in the GWHP plant design phases. To this aim the pumping tests appear to be among the most useful field hydrogeological investigations to be performed in most cases. Such tests can also provide suitable information related to the aquifer productivity (specific discharge rate) and therefore can permit to assess if the GWHP plant requirement can be satisfied in terms of groundwater sustainable withdrawals. A real field pilot plant aimed to supply energy needs to the Architecture Faculty building of the Politecnico di Torino (NW Italy) is presented and discussed. © Società Geologica Italiana, Roma 2016.

TI  - Integrated Energy Design - A new way of teaching, with the use of modern tools to support the design process
PY  - 2016
AU  - Markiewicz, P.
AB  - The article is based on the author's experience with the organisation of Integrated Energy Design workshops, conducted for three years on the basis of a student exchange scheme between Kraków (Poland) and Strasbourg (France). The article describes a new way of teaching architectural design of energy-efficient buildings, with the use of modern supporting tools. Designing a building as an energy-efficient structure has become common today, for environmental, economic and social reasons, as well as being a reaction to legislation. The problem is that the traditional way of designing, taught to this day at many universities does not allow for the design of such buildings. For this reason, there is a need to develop a new method of teaching, which requires a reorganisation of the design process. This is connected with the need to use appropriate tools to support the design process and to shift the main burden of decisions to the earliest stage of design. These tools include computer software in the BIM (building information modelling) standard and related programmes, through which it is possible to perform a series of simulations for a virtual model of the building concerning its energy efficiency. © WIETE 2016.

AB  - Recently, it has been noted that user behaviour can have a large impact on the final energy consumption in buildings. Through the combination ofmathematical modelling and data from wireless ambient sensors, we can model human behaviour patterns and use the information to regulate building management systems (BMS) in order to achieve the best trade-off between user comfort and energy efficiency. Furthermore, streaming sensor data can be used to perform real-time classification. In this work, we have modelled user activity patterns using both offline and online learning approaches based on non-linear multi-class Support Vector Machines. We have conducted a comparison study with other machine learning approaches (i.e. Linear SVM, Hidden-Markov and K-nearestmodels). Experimental results showthat our proposed approach outperforms the other methods for the scenarios evaluated in terms of accuracy and processing speed. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.

TI  - Energetic communities: Planning support for sustainable energy transition in small- and medium-sized communities
PY  - 2016
AU  - Sager-Klauß, C.V.
AB  - The necessity for transition in the energy sector is beyond dispute and high on the political agendas. Climate change, the depletion of fossil fuels and the vulnerability of economies to resource speculation and unreliable political systems in the producing countries lay path for a broad implementation of smart alternative solutions. This means the integration of more sustainable renewable energy sources in the existing supply structures or the displacement of existing systems by new ones. Cities and communities are central players in the energy transition process. Energy demand is determined by the built environment. Renewable energy production needs space. The conflicts between different interest groups often break out in the context of local implementation measures that affect urban planning and the appearance of landscapes. Small- and medium-sized communities might prove to be game-changers in the overall energy transition because many problems have to be solved within their ambit. Urban planning is dealing with the numerous processes of urban change. Energy is a fairly new task to be addressed and many stakeholders lack experience and criteria for strategic decision making. After a period of fierce determination to turn the wheel against climate change, it seems that there is a growing resignation among politicians, planners and the public because some things have not turned out the way we'd expected and the hope for quick solutions fades. Rebound-effects seem to eat up the savings to a good extent, and alternative ideas of how sustainable energy systems may be put into place have not yet been persuasive in many cases. Energy systems have proved to be complex. They are still perceived to be important but in practice there is a growing uneasiness about the right steps to take. The overarching research question of this thesis is: What do decision makers in smalland medium-sized communities need to become more successful in implementing energy transition processes? For the research project this general question was broken down into four primary research questions: - How can communities anchor and monitor long-term energy transition visions in their communal development plans? - What tools and models are available for urban energy system analysis? - How can tools and models be adapted to the specific demands and boundary conditions in the case study communities to ensure long-term implementation of appropriate technologies and measures? - How does the practical implementation of the adapted tools work in the case study and what barriers must be overcome for long-term success? To answer these questions a combination of review of the current state of scientific literature of the thematic field with a practical application and evaluation of 'real' implementation projects was chosen. This appears to be a beneficial approach to scientific research in planning disciplines. The first research question is closely connected to urban planning and strategy. To anchor energy transition goals in these disciplines the potentials and consequences of political energy visions were studied. To monitor developments and progress existing indicator systems were reviewed and adapted to the needs of small- and medium-sized communities. For this overall target-definition the question of 'Exergy Thinking' in planning urban environments and energy systems was discussed. This basically means to create a deep understanding of the quality aspects in energy demand and supply systems and to be aware for better matching solutions. This approach opens many options for the integration of renewables in the heating and cooling supply. It showed that the definition of a clear long-term target or 'energy vision' supports the implementation of measures because it facilitates communication and controversy. The large number of available tools and scientific methods for the analysis and optimization of communal energy systems was reviewed to answer the second research question. The results from this work mainly led to the one central challenge that has to be solved whenever complex modelling and strategic decision making are affected: Data. Data describes the status-quo and gives necessary information on the complex system interactions and influence factors. The options to create a concise data framework for the central objective were addressed in two steps. From literature, existing models and approaches general data frameworks were collected and summarized. Since the method was to be applied to the test case study the data was validated and tested under the case study conditions. This showed deviations and necessary specifications but as well a good analogy to the default data. From this a transparent and adjustable spreadsheet-model was developed to create scenarios for the case study and to answer the fourth research question. To create a holistic picture of the communal energy system and the effects of increased exploitation of renewables geographic information systems (GIS) show very valuable functionalities. Especially since the processing and interpretation of geographic information is anchored in urban planning disciplines and creates an easy access if energy system information is integrated. The open data architecture of GIS allows the integration of different data types as long as they have a spatial correlation. This enables to retrieve valuable results from a scenario model even with rather fragmented and incomplete data. To show the effects of different implementation strategies represented by the different 'energy visions' three energy scenarios were run for the case study. These three scenarios represent central 'beliefs' or 'approaches' in energy transition as well as overall development indicators and specific local aspects. Therefore the success of energy transition measures remains limited if not all essential development parameters take a favorable course. The scenario evaluation shows some interesting results and shows the principal usability of the approach and the model. The base-case scenario shows that the community already reaches good results for the global energy indicators because of the existing measures. On a medium and long-term these measures are not sufficient though to stay on a good course. Especially the long-term developments in some cases produce unexpected results. For instance the rather unfavourable development of CO2-emissions in the renewable energies scenario was not a predictable result at first glance. Here the effects of the chosen technologies and the effects of superior developments show their impact. As well the huge impact of the assumed efficiency measures was somewhat unexpected. Even though the assumed refurbishment rates do not exceed national recommendations and the efficiency qualities are far from passive-house standard, the efficiency scenario shows the fastest and best results for the global environment indicators. This can be explained by the fact that the demand reduction optimally complements the existing renewable energy strategy and can show its full potential in this combination. The results of the smart-city scenario show the expected and desired trends of a moderate and balanced long-term strategy that leads to a slower but continuous positive development in all the analysed energy system indicators. The long-term trends of the scenarios and the effects of following 'plain' strategies can be visualised well with the model and the developed scheme. Therefore the initial research questions can be answered positively. The framework gives good and useful results and offers many options for future extension. Certainly the next and most important aspect to include into the framework is the question of costs and economic effects. The overall investment and operational costs for the measures in the different scenarios will be very different. Efficiency measures especially in the existing building stock are costly while the costs for PV-plants will most probably further decline. This is certainly a shortcoming for the efficiency scenario. A future study could as well look at overall economic effects of the different strategies for the benefit of the community. Basic figures on the economic effects of renewable energy systems are already available (Hirschl et al. 2010) and could be implemented. This would certainly make the framework more beneficial for communal stakeholders. The model is transparent and simple enough to go this way in the near future and the achieved results of this thesis project are a good basis for this. The realisation of energy systems as sketched in the smart cities scenario still demands some changes in the regulatory boundary conditions and some new technologies mainly in the information and communication technologies. Smart and electricity grid compatible buildings which can contribute services in grid stability are an issue still to come and contribute to the integration of renewable electricity. The integration of renewable heat in communal supply systems is a big future opportunity to realise LowEx potentials in the heating and cooling sector. Stakeholders in small- and medium-sized communities should be encouraged by the outcomes of the thesis to take initial steps on the energy transition path, since the results that can be reached with state-of-the-art technologies are very encouraging. Energy transition on a large scale depends on the local implementation. Despite the fact that public and scientific focus and attention is mostly on the megacities, it will be the countless small initiatives that will turn the tide.

AB  - Performance-based building requirements have become more prevalent because it gives freedom in building design while still maintaining or exceeding the energy performance required by prescriptive-based requirements. In order to determine if building designs reach target energy efficiency improvements, it is necessary to estimate the energy performance of a building using predictive models and different weather conditions. Physics-based whole building energy simulation modeling is the most common approach. However, these physics-based models include underlying assumptions and require significant amounts of information in order to specify the input parameter values. An alternative approach to test the performance of a building is to develop a statistically derived predictive regression model using post-occupancy data that can accurately predict energy consumption and production based on a few common weather-based factors, thus requiring less information than simulation models. A regression model based on measured data should be able to predict energy performance of a building for a given day as long as the weather conditions are similar to those during the data collection time frame. This article uses data from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Net-Zero Energy Residential Test Facility (NZERTF) to develop and validate a regression model to predict the energy performance of the NZERTF using two weather variables aggregated to the daily level, applies the model to estimate the energy performance of hypothetical NZERTFs located in different cities in the Mixed-Humid Climate Zone, and compares these estimates to the results from already existing EnergyPlus whole building energy simulations. This regression model exhibits agreement with EnergyPlus predictive trends in energy production and net consumption, but differs greatly in energy consumption. The model can be used as a framework for alternative and more complex models based on the experimental data collected from the NZERTF. © 2016

AB  - Approximately forty percent of total building energy consumption is attributed to HVAC (heating, ventilation, and air conditioning) systems that aim to maintain healthy and comfortable indoor environments. An HVAC system is a network with several subsystems, and there exist heat transfer and balance among the zones of a building, as well as heat gains and losses through a building's envelope. Diverse occupancy (diversity in terms of when and how occupants occupy a building) in spaces could result in increase of loads that are not actual demands for an HVAC system, leading into inefficiencies. This paper introduces a framework to quantitatively evaluate the energy implications of occupancy diversity at the building level, where building information modeling is integrated to provide building geometries, HVAC system layouts, and spatial information as inputs for computing potential energy implications if occupancy diversity were to be eliminated. An agglomerate hierarchical clustering-based iterative evaluation algorithm is designed for iteratively eliminating occupancy diversity. Whole building energy simulations for a real-world building, as well as virtual reference buildings demonstrate that the proposed framework could effectively quantify the HVAC system energy efficiency affected by occupancy diversity and the framework is generalizable to different building geometries, layouts, and occupancy diversities. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The design of urban residential buildings in cold region is different from that in low latitude region, or the design of general public buildings. The precise grasp of dwelling unit type and appearance style, effective control of building heating and thermal insulation efficiency and the implementation of the sustainable concept of low cost construction and environmental protection are dependent on the early scientific and rational design. And the building information model technology just acts as a platform for the optimization of the design. The study is based on the engineering projects; the planning, the design of building facade, collision detection optimization and the full participation of construction cost control in building information model provide a new train of thoughts and research reference for the residential design in cold region, in the context of the digital age, and to a certain extent, the study looks forward to the future urban residential design and construction industrialization prospect in the cold region. Building information modeling technology improves the design efficiency and quality with its precise data processing and analysis, avoids the defects in design and the material waste of construction and environment pollution, significantly enhancing the pre-processing level of construction structure parts, which is in line with the energy-saving environmental protection and rural environmental construction philosophy advocated by the state, and the green building strategies of sustainable development. © 2016 SERSC.

TI  - An algorithm to translate building topology in building information modeling into object-oriented physical modeling-based building energy modeling

AU  - Jeong, W.
AU  - Son, J.
AB  - This paper presents an algorithm to translate building topology in an object-oriented architectural building model (Building Information Modeling, BIM) into an object-oriented physical-based energy performance simulation by using an object-oriented programming approach. Our algorithm demonstrates efficient mapping of building components in a BIM model into space boundary conditions in an object-oriented physical modeling (OOPM)-based building energy model, and the translation of building topology into space boundary conditions to create an OOPM model. The implemented command, TranslatingBuildingTopology, using an object-oriented programming approach, enables graphical representation of the building topology of BIM models and the automatic generation of space boundaries information for OOPM models. The algorithm and its implementation allow coherent object-mapping from BIM to OOPM and facilitate the definition of space boundaries information during model translation for building thermal simulation. In order to demonstrate our algorithm and its implementation, we conducted experiments with three test cases using the BESTEST 600 model. Our experiments show that our algorithm and its implementation enable building topology information to be automatically translated into space boundary information, and facilitates the reuse of BIM data into building thermal simulations without additional export or import processes. © 2016 by the authors.

AB  - In this paper a building occupancy prediction method is presented, which is based on the spatio-temporal analysis of historical data (occupancy modelling) and further relies heavily on current contextual information, being therefore suitable for providing real-time prediction. Two different algorithmic approaches are proposed, based on Markov models, revealing how context awareness adds the capability of rapidly adjusting to current conditions and capturing unexpected events, as opposed to capturing only typical occupancy fluctuation expected on a regular basis. Both proposed approaches are evaluated against accurate real-life data collected from a tertiary building, achieving notable results which outperform currently used methods. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Energy efficient buildings rely on simulation to predict energy performance. However, problems associated with simulation tools can lead to surprises when discrepancies are found between actual and predicted building energy performance; this frustrates building owners, investors, and designers. A probabilistic method of risk assessment for the calculation of energy use intensity and total utility cost in energy performance has been developed. Sensitive and uncertain parameters were selected and given a probability distribution instead of one fixed value for the simulations. Latin hypercube sampling was used to generate input combinations with parameter values picked stochastically from distributions based on the Monte Carlo method. With these input combinations, 10,000 simulations on seven distributed parameters were run using a cloud processing service. The output data, energy use intensity and energy cost, were analyzed using curve-fitting techniques to find a best-fit distribution, which could be used for risk analysis of energy performance and cost. The results illustrate the probability and reliability of prediction within a specific range. Instead of relying on a single value, these curves would help designers better evaluate design alternatives, and the probability distribution of energy performance and cost would be useful in making decisions about investments for energy efficient projects. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Reductions in HVAC (heating, ventilation and air conditioning) energy consumption can be achieved by limiting heating in the winter or cooling in the summer. However, the resulting low thermal comfort of building occupants may lead to an override of the HVAC control, which revokes its original purpose. This has led to an increased interest in modeling and real-time tracking of location, activity, and thermal comfort of building occupants for HVAC energy management. While thermal comfort is well understood, it is difficult to measure in real-time environments where user context changes dynamically. Encouragingly, plethora of sensors available on smartphone unleashes the opportunity to measure user contexts in real-time. An important contextual information for measuring thermal comfort is Metabolism rate, which changes based on current physical activities. To measure physical activity, we develop an activity classifier, which achieves 10% higher accuracy compared to Support Vector Machine and k-Nearest Neighbor. Office occupancy is another contextual information for energy-efficient HVAC control. Most of the phone based occupancy estimation techniques will fail to determine occupancy when phones are left at desk while sitting or attending meetings. We propose a novel sensor fusion method to detect if a user is near the phone, which achieves more than 90% accuracy. Determining activity and occupancy our proposed algorithms can help maintaining thermal comfort while reducing HVAC energy consumptions. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Social BIMCloud: a distributed cloud-based BIM platform for object-based lifecycle information exchange

AB  - Background: The architecture, engineering and construction (AEC) industry lacks a framework for capturing, managing, and exchanging project, product, and social information over the lifecycle of a building. The current tools have various limitations, such as lack of interoperability, slow to transfer huge building model files, and possibility of data inconsistency. Methods: In this paper, we present a cloud-based BIM server framework namely Social BIMCloud that facilitates BIM information exchange through dynamic merging and splitting of building models. The data model of Social BIMCloud is based on but not limited to IFC. The data model of Social BIMCloud was further extended to accommodate social interactions, by studying the formal modes of communication in the AEC industry. An object-based approach to capture and manage social interactions in AEC projects through a BIM-based visual user interface was also developed and demonstrated. Results: Social BIMCloud addresses the issues of inefficient data transfer speed and data inconsistency in a distributed environment by facilitating the storage and partial exchange of integrated nD BIM models. Data interoperability is facilitated through open BIM standards such as IFC and direct integration with construction software. High performance, scalability, fault tolerance, and cost effectiveness are facilitated through data partitioning, data replication strategies, multi-node structures, and pay-per-use tariff systems, respectively, through a cloud-based NoSQL database. Conclusion: The Social BIMCloud framework helps to develop and exchange BIM models, which are rich in project information such as social interactions, cost, and energy analyses. This framework improves the communication efficiency between project participants, leading to better designs and less rework. The information captured by this framework could also be useful to determine important metrics such as industry trends, relationships among project participants, and user requirements. © 2015, Das et al.; licensee Springer.

AB  - Energy efficient building design and construction calls for extensive collaboration between different subfields of the Architecture, Engineering and Construction (AEC) community. Performing building design and construction engineering raises challenges on data integration and software interoperability. Using Building Information Modeling (BIM) data hub to host and integrate building models is a promising solution to address those challenges, which can ease building design information management. However, the partial model query mechanism of current BIM data hub collaboration model has several limitations, which prevents designers and engineers to take advantage of BIM. To address this problem, we propose a general and effective approach to generate query code based on a Model View Definition (MVD). This approach is demonstrated through a software prototype called QueryGenerator. By demonstrating a case study using multi-zone air flow analysis, we show how our approach and tool can help domain experts to use BIM to drive building design with less labour and lower overhead cost. © 2015 The author.

AB  - Most of the building renovation plans are usually decided in the early design stage. This delicate phase contains the greatest opportunity to achieve the high energy performance buildings after refurbishment. It is therefore important to provide the pertinent energy performance information for the designers or decision-makers from multidisciplinary and comparative points of view. This paper investigates the renovation concept of a novel loop-heat-pipe based solar thermal facade (LHP-STF) installed on a reference residential building by technical evaluation and economic analysis in three typical European climates, including North Europe (represented by Stockholm), West Europe (represented by London) and South Europe (represented by Madrid). The aim of this paper is firstly to explore the LHP-STF's sensitivity with regards to the overall building socio-energy performance and secondly to study the LHP-STF's economic feasibility by developing a dedicated business model. The reference building model was derived from the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) commercial buildings research, in which the energy data for the building models were from the ASHRAE codes and other standard practices. The financial data were collected from the European statistic institute and the cost of system was based on the manufactured prototype. Several critical financial indexes were applied to evaluate the investment feasibility of the LHP-STF system in building renovation, such as Payback Period (PP), Net Present Value (NPV), and the modified internal rate of return method (IRR). Four common investment options were considered in this business model, including buying outright (BO), buying by instalment (BI), energy efficiency funding (EEF) and power purchase agreement (PPA). The research results indicate that the LHP-STF could contribute to the hot water load throughout the year with substantially reduced heating load in winter, and yet a slight increased cooling load in summer. Among four investment options, the BO was considered as the best investment method with the highest NPV, IRR and the shortest payback period. With regards to relatively limited solar resources, London was found to be the best place for investment with the highest economical revenues and an attractive payback period of less than four years for all purchase options. Although Madrid has the richest solar resource, this system has the lowest economic profit and the longest payback period. This outcome confirms that the renewable energy incentives have a higher impact than solar resources on current solar thermal facade technologies under such pricing fundamentals. This multidisciplinary research is expected to be helpful for the strategic decisions at the early design stage for building renovation with the proposed system and further promote development of solar driven service system, leading to the savings in fossil fuel consumption and reduction in carbon emission. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The increase in global environmental concerns as well as the advancement of computational tools and methods have had significant impacts on the way in which buildings are being designed. Building professionals are increasingly expected to improve energy performance of their design. To achieve a high level of energy performance, multidisciplinary simulation-based optimization can be utilized to help designers in exploring more design alternatives and making informed decisions. Because of the high complexity in setting up a building model for multi-objective design optimization, there is a great demand of utilizing and integrating the advanced modeling and simulation technologies, including BIM, parametric modeling, cloud-based simulation, and optimization algorithms, as well as a new user interface that facilitates the setup of building parameters (decision variables) and performance fitness functions (design objectives) for automatically generating, evaluating, and optimizing multiple design options. This paper presents an integrated framework for building information modeling (BIM)-based performance optimization, BPOpt. This framework enables designers to explore design alternatives using an open-source, visual programming user interface on the top of a widely used BIM platform, to generate models of building design options, assess the environmental performance of the models through cloud-based simulation, and search for the most appropriate design alternatives. This paper details the process of the development of BPOpt and also provides a case study to show its application. The case study demonstrates the use of BPOpt in minimizing the energy consumption while maximizing the appropriate daylighting level for a residential building. Finally, strengths, limitations, current adoption by academia and industry, and future improvements of BPOpt for high-performance building design are discussed. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Geospatial assessment of potential bioenergy crop production on urban marginal land
PY  - 2015
AU  - Saha, M.
AU  - Eckelman, M.J.
AB  - Urban marginal land can be used for growing high yield bioenergy crops such as miscanthus and poplar. Here, a GIS-based modeling framework was created to assess potential urban marginal lands in Boston that include vacant lands and under-utilized public and private areas with adequate soil quality and sunlight. Using ArcGIS model builder as a spatial analysis tool, land parcels were screened for typical urban features such as buildings, driveways, parking lots, water and protected areas. The resultant layer was subjected to bio-geophysical modeling that includes soil quality, slope analysis and finally shadow analysis. Approximately 2660. ha of potential marginal land was identified as suitable, representing 24% of total land area in Boston. Using crop yield information, it was estimated that this marginal land could be used to produce up to a total of nearly 42,130. tons of high yield short rotation poplar biomass in a regular growing season. Also, bioenergy potential calculation revealed that for short rotation poplar, this amount of biomass can potentially yield up to 745 TJ (LHV) to 830 (HHV) TJ of yearly primary energy for the city of Boston that can be used for heat or electricity production, particularly for microgrid or district heating applications. This is equivalent to ~0.6% of Massachusetts primary energy demand for 2012. Ongoing work will explore other urban regions of Massachusetts and the Eastern US that might be able to fulfill part of their energy demand locally while providing benefits in environmental quality, economic development, and urban resilience. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In this work, new information has been gained on the laboratory-resuspended PM10 fraction from geological topsoil and outcropped rocks representative of the Rome area (Latium). <br><br> Mineralogical composition, size distribution, optical properties and the surface radiative forcing efficiency (RFE) of dust types representing the compositional end members of this geological area have been addressed. A multi-disciplinary approach was used, based on chamber resuspension of raw materials and sampling of the PM10 fraction, to simulate field sampling at dust source, scanning electron microscopy/X-ray energy-dispersive microanalysis (SEM XEDS) of individual mineral particles, X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis of bulk dust samples, building of number and volume size distribution (SD) from microanalysis data of mineral particles and fitting to a log-normal curve, and radiative transfer modelling (RTM) to retrieve optical properties and radiative effects of the compositional end-member dust samples. <br><br> The mineralogical composition of Rome lithogenic PM10 varies between an end-member dominated by silicate minerals (from volcanics lithotypes), and one mostly composed of calcite (from travertine or limestones). Lithogenic PM10 with intermediate composition derives mainly from siliciclastic rocks or marlstones. Size and mineral species of PM10 particles of silicate-dominated dust types are tuned mainly by rock weathering and, to lesser extent, by debris formation or crystallization; chemical precipitation of CaCO3 plays a major role in calcite-dominated types. These differences are reflected in the diversity of volume distributions, either within dust types or mineral species. Differences are also observed between volume distributions of calcite from travertine (natural source; SD unimodal at 5 μm a.d.) and from road dust (anthropic source; SD bimodal at 3.8 and 1.8 μm a.d.). <br><br> The volcanics and travertine dusts differently affect the single scattering albedo (SSA) and the asymmetry parameter (<i>g</i>) in the visible (VIS) and near-infrared (NIR) regions. The downward component of the bottom-of-atmosphere (BOA) solar irradiance simulated by RTM for an atmosphere where only volcanics (or only travertine dust) composes the aerosol, shows that the volcanics contribution to the solar irradiance differs significantly from that of travertine in the NIR region, while similar contributions are modelled in the VIS. The RFE (g'293 W mg'2 for volcanics and g'139 W mg'2 for travertine, at 50° solar zenith angle) shows that volcanics dust produces a stronger cooling effect at surface than travertine, as expected for more absorbing aerosols. © Author(s) 2015.

AB  - With the advent of energy rating systems and increased energy efficiency requirements for built environment, the assessment of energy performance of new buildings and refurbishment rates of existing buildings have become an important compliance in the building design process. In order to analyse and simulate the effects of energy-efficient measures for buildings, it is essential to establish spatio-semantic information interoperability between the building design and energy modelling softwares. Data interoperability facilitates different domains to interact with the single building model. The geometrical properties of building semantics such as effective areas exposed to total incident radiation were used as indicators for assessment of seasonal solar potential of buildings. The key urban solar potential indicators were identified based on the semantic components of buildings. The CityGML instance document derived from a proposed energy application domain extension (ADE) conceptual schema could be used as common interoperable model for both the design and energy simulation systems. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - In recent years, the European Commission has enhanced strategies to promote ICT for energy efficiency in buildings and cities. In the smart city context, energy-related information coming from different data sources - both hardware and software - must be integrated into a common, smart digital archive for the city. DIMMER is a distributed software infrastructure for district information modeling and energy management. It correlates energy-related information from different data sources with user behavior patterns and feedback. Hence, different actors in this scenario can access relevant information for providing new services and developing more efficient policies to enhance energy optimization in cities. This will provide support for strategic city planning and will foster competition in the marketplace. © 2015 IEEE.

AB  - Many cities today are committed to increase the energy efficiency of buildings and the fraction of renewables especially in new urban developments. However, quantitative data on building energy performance as a function of urban density, building compactness and orientation, building use and supply options are rarely available during the design of new cities or early scenario analysis for existing city quarters, making it difficult for cities to effectively evaluate which concepts work today and in the future. The paper proposes a methodology to assess the energy demand and supply options as a function of the availability of geometry, building standard and use data. An automated procedure was implemented to identify each building's geometry and volume and transfer the information to a simulation tool, which then calculates heating demand and solar energy generation on roofs and facades. The simulation includes shading calculations for each segment of the façades and roofs and thus allows a very detailed quantification of the building energy demand.By applying the methodology to a case study city quarter designed in an urban competition in Munich, it could be shown how the urban design influences the energy demand of the quarter and which fractions of renewable energy can be integrated into the roofs. While the building insulation standard and use are the is most important criteria for building energy efficiency (with an impact of more than a factor 2), the exact geometrical form, compactness and urban shading effects influences the energy demand by 10-20%. On the other hand, the detailed roof geometry and orientation influences the possible solar coverage of electricity or thermal needs. Zero energy city quarters with solar resources alone are only possible when all available building surface areas are fully optimized and do not need to fulfill other requirements such as providing roof gardens, terraces or others. Combinations with other more centralized renewable resources such as deep geothermal, solar or biomass heat or cogeneration plants are often necessary to achieve zero energy balances. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Reducing energy consumption in the buildings sector requires significant changes, but technology alone may fail to guarantee efficient energy performance. Human behavior plays a pivotal role in building design, operation, management and retrofit, and is a crucial positive factor for improving the indoor environment, while reducing energy use at low cost. Over the past 40 years, a substantial body of literature has explored the impacts of human behavior on building technologies and operation. Often, need-action-event cognitive theoretical frameworks were used to represent human-machine interactions. In Part I of this paper, a review of more than 130 published behavioral studies and frameworks was conducted. A large variety of data-driven behavioral models have been developed based on field monitoring of the human-building-system interaction. Studies have emerged scattered geographically around the world that lack in standardization and consistency, thus leading to difficulties when comparing one with another. To address this problem, an ontology to represent energy-related occupant behavior in buildings is presented. Accordingly, the technical DNAs framework is developed based on four key components: i) the Drivers of behavior, ii) the Needs of the occupants, iii) the Actions carried out by the occupants, and iv) the building systems acted upon by the occupants. This DNAs framework is envisioned to support the international research community to standardize a systematic representation of energy-related occupant behavior in buildings. Part II of this paper further develops the DNAs framework as an XML (eXtensible Markup Language) schema, obXML, for exchange of occupant information modeling and integration with building simulation tools. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Distributed in-network inference plays a significant role in large-scale wireless sensor networks (WSNs) in various applications for distributed detection and estimation. While belief propagation (BP) holds great potential for forming a powerful underlying mechanism for such distributed in-network inferences in WSNs, one major challenge is how to systematically improve the energy efficiency of BP-based in-network inference in WSNs. In this paper, we first propose a systematic and rigorous data-driven approach to building information models for WSN applications upon which BP-based in-network inference can be effectively and efficiently performed. We then present a wavelet-based BP framework for multiresolution inference, with respect to our WSN information modeling, to further reduce WSNs' energy. We empirically evaluate our proposed WSN information modeling and wavelet-based BP framework/multiresolution inference using real-world sensor network data. The results demonstrate the merits of our proposed approaches. © 2014 IEEE.

AB  - In the existing research on the carbon dioxide emission of buildings, the amount of construction materials in the construction phase is calculated based on the quantity computation sheet. This amount must be re-calculated according to the construction material of the quantity computation sheet when changing the construction design; thus, the reliability and compatibility of the quantity calculation is difficult to achieve. If BIM-based standardized data are used, users can immediately apply the edited factors in the design stage. Moreover, since efficiency and compatibility increase, the accuracy of the analysis and computation of CO 2 emission from various building materials can be expected. The purpose of this paper is to present a BIM-based building carbon dioxide emission quantity assessment method to analyse the reduction of energy consumption and the CO 2 emission quantity objectively and quantitatively. The accuracy of BIM-based quantity estimation according to major construction materials is examined based on the BIM library and the modelling construction method, and guidelines are provided to the users. © 2015, Architectural Institute of Japan.

TI  - Integrating decision support system (DSS) and building information modeling (BIM) to optimize the selection of sustainable building components
PY  - 2015
AU  - Jalaei, F.

AB  - One of the challenges in sustainability analysis and its development is the optimum selection of sustainable materials to meet the project's requirements while doing sustainable design. This can only be achieved when project team adopt the use of a strategic approach while selecting the materials, although this could be a complex task for decision makers. Building Information Modeling (BIM) offers designers the ability to assess different design alternatives at the conceptual stage of a project. As a method of integration and through its modeling techniques, BIM can be used to assess the impacts of design alternatives on the energy saving of buildings all over their life. Furthermore, BIM has the potential to help designers select the right type of materials during the early design stage, and make vital decisions when selecting the materials that have sustainable impact on the building's life cycle. The main purpose of this study is to propose a methodology that integrates BIM with decision-making problem-solving approaches (i.e. Entropy-TOPSIS) in order to efficiently optimize the selection of sustainable building components at the conceptual design stage of building projects. Therefore, a Decision Support System (DSS) is developed by using Multiple Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) techniques to aid the design team decide on and select the optimum type of sustainable building components and design families while doing conceptual design of proposed projects, based on three main criteria (i.e. environmental factors, economic factors-"cost efficiency," and social well-being) in an attempt to identify the influence of design variations on the whole building's sustainable performance. The multi-criteria procedure embedded in the DSS relies on numerical models to simulate alternative situations, as well as ranking the alternatives and select the best ones based on both the owners' strategic preferences and the availability of sustainable materials in the market. The set of models included in the DSS describes the relationship between sustainability criteria, manufacturers' sustainable materials and the interactions between project team that take place during the design of sustainable building projects. This paper aims at exposing the feasibility of using BIM for analysing the life cycle costs of sustainable buildings at the conceptual stage. The design alternatives suggested by the DSS are evaluated in an integrated environment that joins BIM concept and Life Cycle Cost (LCC) method to analyze the operational cost of the whole building. An actual building project is used to validate the workability and capability of the proposed methodology. © 2015 The author.

AB  - Environmental problems, especially climate change, have become a serious global issue waiting for people to solve. In the construction industry, the concept of sustainable building is developing to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. In this study, a building information modeling (BIM) based building design optimization method is proposed to facilitate designers to optimize their designs and improve buildings' sustainability. A revised particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is applied to search for the trade-off between life cycle costs (LCC) and life cycle carbon emissions (LCCE) of building designs. In order to validate the effectiveness and efficiency of this method, a case study of an office building is conducted in Hong Kong. The result of the case study shows that this method can enlarge the searching space for optimal design solutions and shorten the processing time for optimal design results, which is really helpful for designers to deliver an economic and environmental-friendly design scheme. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In this paper, we discuss the results of a sensitivity analysis of Res-IRF, an energy-economy model of the demand for space heating in French dwellings. Res-IRF has been developed for the purpose of increasing behavioral detail in the modeling of energy demand. The different drivers of energy demand, namely the extensive margin of energy efficiency investment, the intensive one and building occupants, behavior are disaggregated and determined endogenously. The model also represents the established barriers to the diffusion of energy efficiency: heterogeneity of consumer preferences, landlord-tenant split incentives and slow diffusion of information. The relevance of these modeling assumptions is assessed through the Morris method of sensitivity analysis, which allows for the exploration of uncertainty over the whole input space. We find that the Res-IRF model is most sensitive to energy prices. It is also found to be quite sensitive to the factors parameterizing the different drivers of energy demand. In contrast, inputs mimicking barriers to energy efficiency have been found to have little influence. These conclusions build confidence in the accuracy of the model and highlight occupants' behavior as a priority area for future empirical research. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - When reconfigured into a cohesive system, a series of existing digital technologies may facilitate disassembly, take back and reuse of structural steel components, thereby improving resource efficiency and opening up new business paradigms. The paper examines whether Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology coupled with Building Information Modelling (BIM) may enable components and/or assemblies to be tracked and imported into virtual models for new buildings at the design stage. The addition of stress sensors to components, which provides the capability of quantifying the stress properties of steel over its working life, may also support best practice reuse of resources. The potential to improve resource efficiency in many areas of production and consumption, emerging from a novel combination of such technologies, is highlighted using a theoretical case study scenario. In addition, a case analysis of the demolition/deconstruction of a former industrial building is conducted to illustrate potential savings in energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions (GGE) from reuse when compared with recycling. The paper outlines the reasoning behind the combination of the discussed technologies and alludes to some possible applications and new business models. For example, a company that currently manufactures and 'sells' steel, or a third party, could find new business opportunities by becoming a 'reseller' of reused steel and providing a 'steel service'. This could be facilitated by its ownership of the database that enables it to know the whereabouts of the steel and to be able to warrant its properties and appropriateness for reuse in certain applications. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - As half of the world’s population live in cities today, the topic of urbanization and urban energy systems shift continuously into society’s focus. It has become a common challenge for local governments to provide a so called “Master Plan”, outlining a long term vision for the city’s energy infrastructure, to which all planners and investors have to adhere. Being a top-down approach, these Master plans are first of all politically motivated documents, which focus on achieving given targets, such as CO2- emission reductions or higher shares of electric mobility. Originating from these targets, a set of milestones and measures is derived, e.g., the implementation of certain green technologies or refurbishments of buildings. The goal of this paper is to elaborate a model, which allows analysis of a Master Plan from a bottom-up perspective and thereby quantitatively assesses the plan with regards to its feasibility, while identifying possible bottlenecks in its implementation. The results can then serve the city planners to adapt their planning in order to avoid unforeseen problems, when putting the plan’s measures into practice. The approach pursued in this research is a combination of system dynamics and an agent-based simulation model of the city’s energy system, providing both a high spatial and temporal granularity. The model is developed with the multi-method modelling tool Anylogic and with Geographic Information System (GIS). The city itself is represented with its existing building and power infrastructure, which is then subject to the planned measures and developments. The core of the model implements on the one hand different energy generation technologies, both fossil fuels and renewables, reaching from big power plants to small local PV-installations on a private household’s roof. On the other hand, the heat and electricity consumers are represented through the buildings. The aim of the model is, at first, to provide a support system to analyze the short and long term effects of the Master Plan. Since its measures are usually not planned in detail concerning exact location or timing of the realization, the simulation results can provide references on these specific details. Secondly, the findings are used to identify the impact of single planned measures and their combinations which answers the questions of how, when and where local electricity and heat producers and the energy efficiency measures influence one another and if they have synergetic or competitive effects. Finally, a set of recommendations is derived from the analyses, which can help the city planners to transfer the strategic measures of the Master Plan into operative business. © 2015, Emergent Publications.

AB  - The electricity consumption in the buildings sector has been steadily increasing during the last decade, up to the point that energy efficiency in this sector has become a major problem for governments, utilities, customers, and the environment. The foreseen high penetration of distributed micro-generation facilities based on renewables can help to reduce the environmental footprint of buildings and households, although the complexity of managing effectively the electric grid increases dramatically under these conditions. The IEEE 2030 standard for interoperability in the Smart Grid remarks upon the importance of well-defined data models in such complex scenarios and puts emphasis on the benefits of ontologies and OWL (Web Ontology Language) for this purpose. This paper presents an OWL-based ontology that formally defines the vocabulary and taxonomy and captures the engineering and business semantics of this domain of knowledge (i.e., energy efficiency in the so-called nZEN - nearly Zero-Energy Neighborhoods). This ontology has been defined under the scope of the EU (European Union) research project ENERsip. The paper also highlights the main benefits the ontology brought to all the phases of the project life cycle, as well as how future work can make the most out of it. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Abstract During planning and design stages of energy efficient houses investor and designer deal with requirement to ensure very low energy consumption in operational stage of building life cycle. Any deviation appeared after building commissioning will result non-compliance with regulatory requirements. Currently, the energy simulations of the residential building do not provide the approach, which would help comprehensively evaluate differences of occupants' characteristics (age, behaviour, etc.), neither in energy performance certification methodologies nor in energy simulation software. The objective of study is to perform complex analysis of the effect of domestic occupancy profiles on the energy performance of energy efficient house and assess applicability of default DesignBuilder occupancy profiles at local conditions. Results show that the influence of the profile with 4 occupants (OP2) on overall primary energy demand for different cases is never exceeding 5% compared to default DesignBuilder profiles. The influence of households with 2 occupants (OP3, OP4) on overall primary energy demand varies from 14% to 21% compared to default profiles. The simulation results revealed that the use of different occupancy profiles correlates with the total energy performance of the building. Incorporation of occupancy information in energy simulations will improve the accuracy of the energy performance assessment. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This research investigates the relationship between energy use, geographic location, life cycle environmental impacts, and Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED). The researchers studied worldwide variations in building energy use and associated life cycle impacts in relation to the LEED rating systems. A Building Information Modeling (BIM) of a reference 43 000 ft2 office building was developed and situated in 400 locations worldwide while making relevant changes to the energy model to meet reference codes, such as ASHRAE 90.1. Then life cycle environmental and human health impacts from the buildings energy consumption were calculated. The results revealed considerable variations between sites in the U.S. and international locations (ranging from 394 ton CO2 equiv to 911 ton CO2 equiv, respectively). The variations indicate that location specific results, when paired with life cycle assessment, can be an effective means to achieve a better understanding of possible adverse environmental impacts as a result of building energy consumption in the context of green building rating systems. Looking at these factors in combination and using a systems approach may allow rating systems like LEED to continue to drive market transformation toward sustainable development, while taking into consideration both energy sources and building efficiency. © 2015 American Chemical Society.

AU  - Fischbeck, P.S.
AB  - In this study we model and examine the energy efficiency profile of individual single-family houses from Gainesville, Florida, in our sample (n = 7091). For this we use Princeton Scorekeeping Method (PRISM) which processes historical weather data and monthly utility usage data as inputs using an iterative regression approach to compute three energy efficiency parameters: (1) baseload consumption for end-uses which do not change with weather, e.g.; lighting, refrigerator, water heater; (2) heating/cooling slope which is a function of the building shell insulation and the efficiency of the heating/cooling unit; (3) reference temperature, i.e.; the outside temperature at which the house turns on heating/cooling. These parameters make up the normalized annual consumption (NAC). We then proceed to regress these parameters against the publicly available data to study the extent we can extract statistical insight for residential energy efficiency profiling using publicly available information (n = 5243). These regression models are to pave a path to creating energy efficiency "reservoir maps" across individual homes and reducing the information barrier to energy efficiency adoption. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Indoor air temperature monitoring is a basic activity giving useful information in many fields such as human thermal comfort, food preservation conditions and energy simulations. The collected data can help the room management and, their elaborations, can improve energy-efficient building design. The survey equipment installation in an indoor space - sensor number and positions, record frequency - is a delicate procedure depending on several conditions related to the specific room. Nevertheless specific installation procedures are nor defined or codified in the scientific literature. This study aims at the definition of a temperature survey method, both accurate and cost-effective, able to quantify and maximize precision and accuracy of the temperature monitoring in indoor spaces, through an experimental temperature test carried out on a wine-aging room of an Italian wine farm. The method allows to identify homogeneous temperature zones, the number of sensors to be installed and the proper data recording frequency, based on the specific needs of the process under study. This method is experimentally validated by means of a test carried out on a wine-aging room. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Integrated model for characterization of spatiotemporal building energy consumption patterns in neighborhoods and city districts

AU  - Schlueter, A.
AB  - We introduce an integrated model for characterization of spatiotemporal building energy consumption patterns in neighborhoods and city districts. The model addresses the need for a comprehensive method to identify present and potential states of building energy consumption in the context of urban transformation. The focus lies on determining the spatiotemporal variability of energy services in both standing and future buildings in the residential, commercial and industrial sectors. This detailed characterization facilitates the assessment of potential energy efficiency measures at the neighborhood and city district scales. In a novel approach we integrated existing methods in urban and energy planning domains such as spatial analysis, dynamic building energy modeling and energy mapping to provide a comprehensive, multi-scale and multi-dimensional model of analysis. The model is part of a geographic information system (GIS), which serves as a platform for the allocation and future dissemination of spatiotemporal data. The model is validated against measured data and a peer model for a city district in Switzerland. In this context, we present practical applications in the analysis of energy efficiency measures in buildings and urban zoning. We furthermore discuss potential applications in educational, urban and energy planning practices. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - A sustainable building is constructed of materials that could decrease environmental impacts, such as energy usage, during the lifecycle of the building. Building Information Modeling (BIM) has been identified as an effective tool for building performance analysis virtually in the design stage. The main aims of this study were to assess various combinations of materials using BIM and identify alternative, sustainable solutions to reduce operational energy consumption. The amount of energy consumed by a double story bungalow house in Johor, Malaysia, and assessments of alternative material configurations to determine the best energy performance were evaluated by using Revit Architecture 2012 and Autodesk Ecotect Analysis software to show which of the materials helped in reducing the operational energy use of the building to the greatest extent throughout its annual life cycle. At the end, some alternative, sustainable designs in terms of energy savings have been suggested. © 2014 Production and hosting by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of Ain Shams University.

TI  - The life cycle assessment of a UK data centre
PY  - 2015
AU  - Whitehead, B.

AU  - Shah, A.
AB  - Purpose: Data centres are high-energy consumers, and historical assessment of their environmental impact has focused largely on energy consumption. Widely adopted assessment methods consider either single issues or do not comprehensively assess links between issues. One exception is the CLEER Model, which compares life cycle energy and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of Cloud-based and present-day services. However, there remains the need to verify components for inclusion in a data centre life cycle assessment (LCA), assess quality and quantity of secondary data, benchmark an existing data centre LCA, assess non-Cloud-based services for multiple impacts, and establish facility areas that are sensitive to change. Methods: A hybrid approach, combining process-based and economic input output (EIO) data, was used to perform the screening LCA of an existing UK data centre. The study includes the definition of the goal and scope, modelling assumptions, a life cycle inventory, results and interpretation and a sensitivity check. Results and discussion: The dominance of the information technology (IT) operational phase to the overall impact and the severity of the impact on human health are concluded. Due to the use of free cooling, the IT-embodied impact is greater than the combined mechanical and electrical operational impact. Electricity production dominates the total life cycle impact; however, the second most significant impact derives from the disposal of metal refining waste products during the manufacture of IT components and electricity distribution networks. The release of carcinogens is one of the largest contributors to the whole life cycle impact and is almost equal in value between the embodied and operational phases. Finally, a sensitivity check found that a Swedish facility optimised for operational energy efficiency with a 1.25-year server refresh resulted in an embodied impact almost double the operational. Conclusions: It was concluded that current LCI data, software packages and project data allow for a sufficiently accurate data centre LCA model. The results support the need to broaden environmental impact reduction to beyond operational energy consumption for cooling and that building environmental assessment methods (BEAMs) should consider more embodied impacts. It is concluded also that three parameters are sensitive to design changes that influence the overall impact: operational energy for the IT equipment, cooling and power delivery; the energy mix; and the amount of IT equipment across the facility’s lifetime. The results present a clear need to monitor life cycle impact, develop further tools to compare different design/operation options and functional units, improve data and develop an LCA-based BEAM. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - One of the biggest global issues at present involves the search for measures to conserve energy and to combat climate change. Because of an increase in natural disasters and energy use, architects and engineers have been focusing more on creating green buildings with low-carbon designs. Building information modeling (BIM) is used to record all of the data related to buildings from the early design stage. This information can be used to respond to energy simulation feedback and to accommodate changes that may be necessary during the design developments. To mitigate greenhouse gas emissions and to conserve energy in the buildings, the application of a BIM-based low-carbon design technique is required from the early design stage. However, the existing research is limited to sub-segmented topics; therefore, it is difficult for designers to establish a rank grade for a low-carbon design technique that is required for application in design planning. In this study, we attempt to analyze the rank grade and the correlation among design components that affect a building’s energy performance. We selected tower buildings for the experiment, as they consume a massive amount of energy and have a large impact on the surrounding environment. We analyzed the values that resulted from different shapes, scales, slenderness ratios, window-to-wall ratios, and solar orientations of the tower buildings. Then, we identified a correlation and rank grade among different design components. Architects can maximize energy performance efficiency by considering and applying the rank grade of a low-carbon design technique during design planning. In addition, the development of guidelines for green BIM would reduce confusion in the decision-making process and design modification during the stages of design development, which would then minimize the cost. Furthermore, it is expected that this study can be used to create a database for the realization of green buildings. © 2015, College Publishing. All rights reserved.

AB  - Smart metering and fine-grained energy data are one of the major enablers for future smart grid and improved energy efficiency in smart homes. Using the information provided by smart meter power draw, valuable information can be extracted as disaggregated appliance power draws by non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM). NILM allows to identify appliances according to their power characteristics in the total power consumption of a household, measured by one sensor, the smart meter. In this paper, we present an NILM approach, where the appliance states are estimated by particle filtering (PF). PF is used for nonlinear and non-Gaussian disturbed problems and is suitable to estimate the appliance state. ON/OFF appliances, multistate appliances, or combinations of them are modeled by hidden Markov models, and their combinations result in a factorial hidden Markov model modeling the household power demand. We evaluate the PF-based NILM approach on synthetic and on real data from a well-known dataset to show that our approach achieves an accuracy of 90% on real household power draws. © 1963-2012 IEEE.

AB  - This paper presents a methodology how energy consumption and energy inefficiencies can be quantified for industrial processes based on a general, branch- independent approach for the purpose of increasing energy efficiency. For many companies the information of the actual energy use of their processes is very limited. Therefore, knowledge of energy consumption is only available on an overall basis and the product- specific energy costs are often calculated with a common cost- plus system. This deficiency in information is part of the reasons, why energy efficiency potentials are often neither known nor realized. For that reason a general approach is needed, which (1) uses the actual economic data of a company and (2) combines and compares it with thermodynamic analyses in order to (3) calculate the actual energy consumption of processes and products to (4) identify and quantify the energy efficiency potentials. The suggested general approach is branch- independent and analyses energy efficiency potentials. Firstly this is conducted through a modular- based, three- level industrial model mapping process. Each module contains production units (industrial plant assets), where main industrial processes are integrated into one module. The different modules are then connected on different levels in order to find product- specific production pathways. Secondly, both a top- down and a bottom- up approach are implemented. The top- down approach uses economic and overall energy consumption data and transfers it to the modular view. The bottom- up approach applies technical data of the used production units and quantifies energy consumption based on thermodynamic and general technical data. Through this methodology it is possible to derive actual energy consumption of processes and corresponding manufactured products, which furthermore helps to understand energy cost generation for various products. It also divides the possible inefficiencies into a technical and an organisational part which leads to technical, organisational and social measures. The described modelling of industrial processes on a modular, multilevel approach is applied to case studies for several Austrian foundry companies. Actual data is used for (1) building the model (2) evaluate the model and (3) make the actual energy consumption of processes more transparent. The case studies show that important information is concealed through wrong energy allocations and thus prevents the knowledge of energy efficiency potentials. The application of the model approach in foundry companies enables to (1) calculate energy consumption for various important modules, (2) transfer economic and technical data to a process- oriented picture of the energy use, (3) calculate energy demand of various products and (4) provides the first basis for energy efficiency potential analysis.

AB  - Semantic web technologies can help to integrate heterogeneous data sources, and to make them accessible to the stakeholders involved in the urban energy planning. In the SEMANCO project, semantic technologies have been used to create models of urban energy systems able to assess the energy performance of an urban area. A semantic energy information framework brings together the data sources at different scales and from different domains (e.g. urban planning, energy management), as well as some energy simulation and assessment tools that interact with the semantically modelled data. An ontology based on a vocabulary of concepts shared by experts has been created through the following process: capturing the experts knowledge about a specific problem regarding the energy efficiency of an urban area and the data needed to model it; creating an informal vocabulary through the terms referred to technical standards, and creating a formal vocabulary according to the Ontology Web Language specifications. This ontology has been applied to three case studies in the SEMANCO project. The ontology can be reused in other cases dealing with modelling of urban energy systems using semantic technologies and its underlying methodology - knowledge capturing, informal vocabulary creation, ontology building - could be replicated in other domains. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Insufficient interoperability resulting from complex data exchange between architectural design and building energy simulation prevents the efficient use of energy performance analyses in the early design stage. This paper presents the development of a Modelica library for Building Information Modeling (BIM)-based building energy simulation (ModelicaBIM library) using an Object-Oriented Physical Modeling (OOPM) approach and Modelica, an equation-based OOPM language. By using the ModelicaBIM library, our project investigates system interfaces between BIM and energy simulation, which can perform semi-automatic translation from the building models in BIM to building energy modeling (BEM) using a BIM's authoring tool's Application Programming Interface (API). The ModelicaBIM library consists of OOPM-based BIM classes and OOPM-based BIM structure. OOPM-based BIM classes represent building component information. OOPM-based BIM structure consists of test case models that demonstrate (i) how building information in BIM can be transformed to OOPM and (ii) how design operations in BIM, such as changing a building geometry and editing building components, can be translated into BEM. A case study for simulation result comparisons has been conducted using (i) OOPM-based BIM models in the ModelicaBIM library and (ii) LBNL Modelica Buildings library (a Modelica-based building thermal simulation library developed by Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory). Our implementation shows that the ModelicaBIM library enables (i) objects in BIM to be translated into the OOPM-based energy models and (ii) existing OOPM library to be utilized as a simulation solver for BIM-based energy simulation. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This study aims to evaluate the extent to which building material specification affects life cycle environmental performance, using a building information modelling (BIM)-enhanced life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology. A combination of the BIM-based design and analysis tool Revit Architecture, the energy simulation tool Green Building Studio (GBS) and the LCA tool ATHENA Impact Estimator were used for the assessment. The LCA was carried out on a life case study of a 2100 m2 two-floor primary-school building, as well as a variability analysis, by varying the material specification in terms of whole building materials. The life cycle performance of the buildings was primarily evaluated in terms of its global warming potential (GWP) and health impact. The findings of the study show that irrespective of the materials used, buildings that are based on renewable energy perform better than those based on fossil fuels over their life cycle. In terms of building materials, both environmental and health preferences of buildings congruently range from timber, brick/block and steel to insulated concrete formwork (ICF), in descending order. The study suggests that as buildings become more energy efficient during operational stages, serious attention needs to be given to their embodied impact. The study lays out a methodological framework that could be adopted by industry practitioners in evaluating life cycle environmental impact of different BIM-modelled material options at the building conception stage. This has the tendency to ensure that the highest proportion of life cycle environmentally beneficial material combinations are selected during specification and construction. © 2015, © 2015 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - The performance of concrete products depends not only on the concrete compositions but also on the dimensions and the environment they are placed in. Numerical simulations are excellent tools to predict the performance of concrete products before actually making them and thus serve as a tool for product design. The present numerical studies were focused, firstly, on the prediction of the mechanical and thermal behaviour of concrete products when applied in façade walls and, secondly, on the prediction of the energy efficiency of buildings composed by such products. Different concrete mixtures were considered, depending to their target application (blocks or panels, e.g.). Façade walls were considered to be exposed to realistic weather conditions and focus was put on the stresses resulting from thermal expansion. For the "house/building" level, an energy efficiency analysis was performed for different types of buildings, which were assumed to be exposed to typical cold winter and hot summer weather conditions. This resulted in detailed information on the energy balance of the resulting structures such as energy consumption with HVAC (heating, ventilating, and air conditioning) systems. An integrated multi-level approach, from concrete components to building structures, was developed, enabling to compare the performance of different concrete compositions.

TI  - Requirements of integrated design teams while evaluating advanced energy retrofit design options in immersive virtual environments
PY  - 2015
AU  - Yang, X.

AB  - One of the significant ways to save energy use in buildings is to implement advanced energy retrofits in existing buildings. Improving energy performance of buildings through advanced energy retrofitting requires a clear understanding of the cost and energy implications of design alternatives from various engineering disciplines when different retrofit options are considered. The communication of retrofit design alternatives and their energy implications is essential in the decision-making process, as it affects the final retrofit selections and hence the energy efficiency of the retrofitted buildings. The objective of the research presented here was to identify a generic list of information requirements that are needed to be shared and collectively analyzed by integrated design teams during advanced energy retrofit design review meetings held in immersive settings. While identifying such requirements, the authors used an immersive environment based iterative requirements elicitation approach. The technology was used as a means to better identify the information requirements of integrated design teams to be analyzed as a group. This paper provides findings on information requirements of integrated design teams when evaluating retrofit options in immersive virtual environments. The information requirements were identified through interactions with sixteen experts in design and energy modeling domain, and validated with another group of participants consisting of six design experts who were experienced in integrated design processes. Industry practitioners can use the findings in deciding on what information to share with integrated design team members during design review meetings that utilize immersive virtual environments. © 2015 by the authors.

AB  - The New Zealand building design industry assumes various building model inputs for the consumption of energy through lighting and appliances. It also makes assumptions regarding when these energy consumers are considered to be "turned on". This paper aims to better inform industry energy modellers about the real load and operation of real commercial buildings in New Zealand when compared to New Zealand Standard energy efficiency requirements and assumptions. The paper presents a set of New Zealand relevant commercial building operation information. Typical operation information is provided for three commercial building types: (1) Office; (2) Retail; and (3) Mixed/Other. The information provides low, typical, and high installed building load and operation pattern scenarios for the three building types. The typical data presented in this paper is significantly different to the load requirement and operation modelling assumptions presented in the New Zealand Building code. The results established in this paper are informed by data gathered in the Building Research Association of New Zealand (BRANZ) Building Energy End-Use Study (BEES). The purpose of BEES is to increase knowledge on energy use patterns for the entire New Zealand building stock. The intention of this paper is to disseminate the established knowledge that will eventually update the assumptions used in New Zealand commercial energy models. © 2015 by the authors.

AB  - Building information modelling (BIM) provides architectural 3D visualization and a standardized way to share and exchange building information. Recently, there has been an increasing interest in using BIM, not only for design and construction, but also the post-construction management of the built facility. With the emergence of smart built environment (SBE) technology, which embeds most spaces with smart objects to enhance the building's efficiency, security and comfort of its occupants, there is a need to understand and address the challenges BIM faces in the design, construction and management of future smart buildings. In this paper, we investigate how BIM can contribute to the development of SBE. Since BIM is designed to host information of the building throughout its life cycle, our investigation has covered phases from architecture design to facility management. Firstly, we extend BIM for the design phase to provide material/device profiling and the information exchange interface for various smart objects. Next, we propose a three-layer verification framework to assist BIM users in identifying possible defects in their SBE design. For the post-construction phase, we have designed a facility management tool to provide advanced energy management of smart grid-connected SBEs, where smart objects, as well as distributed energy resources (DERs) are deployed. © 2015 by the authors.

AB  - Today, a new generation of software applications can be developed, as IT services developed by software providers can be integrated by solution developers in complex control and monitoring Smart Building Management solutions. This paper introduces the concept of Virtual Smart Building Service Enterprise (SBSE) as a novel perspective to develop an innovated services ecosystem for smart buildings. The Virtual SBSE allows different stakeholder categories to interact in order to develop, publish, compose, discover, integrate and use specific functionalities exposed as services for smart building management. An extended implementation case study is developed around an open software platform for modelling, virtualising, and managing complex services, including energy consumption. It integrates in the operational loop a Smart Building Controller exposed as a service that home users can download, install and use in their homes for the control and monitoring of energy consumption, or for ambient comfort. Different schedules and policies for individual devices or groups of devices can be defined based on daily working or living user schedules, so that the users may evaluate and adjust energy cost based on their own preferences, achieving their energy efficiency goals. The Virtual SBSE concept and the energy efficiency case study presented in the paper demonstrate how the easy open integration of diverse information systems enabling the creation of new smart building management services and involving users in value co creation can be attained. © 2015, Gh.

AB  - This paper presents the theoretical basis of the matrix method direct-applied to determine the heat losses of the building and harmonized with the requirements very urgent regulatory documents. Matrix method consists in drawing up a series of matrices with geometrical and thermal characteristics and their subsequent multiplication by the rules of linear algebra. Matrix method is the most accurate way to determine the transmission heat losses and, consequently, the required heating power, because linear and point thermal bridges attached in Annex E SP 50.13330.2012 "Thermal performance of the buildings". The updated edition SNIP 23-02-2003 are taken into account. Tools of linear algebra allow to operate with a large data sets and take into account a number of different factors affecting the thermal balance of the building simultaneously. Matrix method is easily automated. Even the simplest tabular editors allow adapting them to write matrices and perform an operation of multiplication of matrices. In complex matrices using the opportunity to make up for the buildings detailed data array that is an information model of the thermal climate of the building is appeared. Approach realized by the matrix method corresponds the direction of development of science given at the federal level in Russian Federation - on energy saving and achieving maximal energy efficiency fully.

TI  - Mapping actual thermal properties to building elements in gbXML-based BIM for reliable building energy performance modeling

AU  - Ham, Y.
AU  - Golparvar-Fard, M.
AB  - The ability to import building geometric and construction thermal data from building information models (BIM) has significant potential to reduce the time and uncertainty in building energy modeling process. In today's BIM-based energy modeling practice, thermal properties are mainly derived from generic building construction types in BIM. However, for energy modeling of existing buildings, such assumptions are often inaccurate as they do not account for diminishing thermal resistances of building materials instigated by their deteriorations. To improve the reliability of BIM-based energy modeling, we present a system, together with new methods for automated association and updating of actual thermal property measurements with BIM elements in gbXML schema. By leveraging collections of digital and thermal images and based on environmental measurements, our system first produces a 3D thermal model for the building under inspection and then derives the actual thermal resistances of the building assemblies at the level of 3D vertexes. By associating these measurements with their corresponding elements in gbXML, thermal properties of the BIM elements are automatically updated. Our experiments in real-world residential and instructional buildings show how actual thermal properties can be automatically associated with BIM elements and updated in gbXML. The proposed method shortens the gap between architectural information in BIM and the actual data needed for energy performance simulation, and enables reliable BIM-based energy analysis for retro-commissioning, continuous commissioning, and retrofit. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Building integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) systems are drawing attention as efficient energy generation systems because they combine functional building components with the capabilities of a photovoltaic system. It is important to verify the plant performance of BIPV systems according to building certification processes and mandatory requirements for new and renewable energy. However, a sufficient number of tests have not been conducted to set and verify policies for BIPV performance. Building information modeling (BIM) systems offer a major solution to the challenges associated with supplying, installing, and verifying BIPV systems. This study was conducted to promote the supply and stimulation of new and renewable energy sources. A BIM application plan is proposed to make the installation and supply of BIPV systems more efficient considering the certification system established by the government’s new and renewable energy dissemination program. © 2015, ICIC International.

AB  - In recent years 3D models of buildings are used in maintenance and inspection, preservation, and other building related applications. However, the usage of these models is limited because most models are pure representations with no or little associated semantics. In this paper we present a pipeline of techniques used for interior interpretation, object detection, and adding energy related semantics to windows of a 3D thermal model. A sequence of algorithms is presented for building the fundamental semantics of a 3D model. Among other things, these algorithms enable the system to differentiate between objects in a room and objects that are part of the room, e.g. floor, windows. Subsequently, the thermal information is used to construct a stochastic mathematical model– namely Markov Random Field– of the temperature distribution of the detected windows. As a result, the MAP(Maximum a posteriori) framework is used to further label the windows as either open, closed or damaged based upon their temperature distribution. The experimental results showed the robustness of the techniques. Furthermore, a strategy to optimize the free parameters is described, in cases where there is a sample training dataset. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

TI  - Uncertainty of daylight illuminance on vertical building façades when determined from sky scanner data: A numerical study
PY  - 2014
AU  - Kómar, L.
AU  - Kocifaj, M.
AB  - Proper assessment of building façade illumination by natural daylight is a key factor in active utilization of renewable solar energy. Theoretical modeling of sky luminance distribution supported by long-term measurements in a local atmosphere is useful in designing energy efficient buildings on regional basis. The luminance patterns can be inferred from the whole-sky scanners available world-wide, but the information content of raw data need to be analyzed in detail before used in evaluation of the daylight climate. In this paper, the sky scanner accuracy is quantified based on so-called density function and device-specific sky coverage. The numerical experiments are made on synthetically generated luminance patterns using CIE model that benefits from its computationally inexpensive implementation. The inaccuracy of vertical illuminance determined out of scanned luminance data can be several tens of percent if instrumental field of view (FOV) exceeds 10°. Therefore the family of sky scanners with wider FOV appears unreliable for quantifying the daylight availability in building interiors. Most typically the light signals from low elevation angles show large contribution to the illuminance on a vertically oriented façade, except for overcast skies where density function peaks at intermediate almucantars. Vertical illuminances computed from some commercially available sky scanner data suffer from uncertainty, implying that more accurate programmable devices ought to be designed. A good compromise between scanning time and amount of data required was found for FOV. =. 5°. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Integrating Building Information Modeling (BIM) and energy analysis tools with green building certification system to conceptually design sustainable buildings
PY  - 2014
AU  - Jalaei, F.
AU  - Jrade, A.
AB  - It is commonly known that the energy consumption of buildings is quite high; therefore, owners, architects, and engineers should be more concerned about the sustainability and energy performance of proposed building projects. For years, energy analysis tools have been used by designers to design energyefficient buildings. Generally, the energy analysis for this type of facilities is mostly conducted at the end of the design stage, once their components and elements have already been selected. However, analyzing the energy consumption of those components at the conceptual design stage is very helpful for designers when making decisions related to the selection of the most suitable design alternative that will lead to an energy-efficient building. Building Information Modeling (BIM) has the capability to help users assess different design alternatives and select vital energy strategies and systems at the conceptual design stage of proposed projects. Furthermore, by using BIM tools, designers are able to select the right type of materials early during the design stage and to make energy-related decisions that have great impact on the whole building life cycle. The main objective of this paper is to propose an integrated methodology that links BIM and energy analysis tools with green building certification systems. This methodology will be applied at the early design stage of a project's life. It will help designers measure and identify potential loss or gain of energy for different design alternatives and calculate the potential LEED points they may accumulate and gain and accordingly select the best one. An actual building project will be used to illustrate the workability and capability of the proposed methodology. © 2014 The authors.

The used calculation method is based on a bottom-up approach and is implemented in a case district. The visualization of the energy and emission results employs geographical information system (GIS) techniques. We show two examples of how impacts of behavioral and technical changes in the building stock can be assessed and visualized by using the approach. The results obtained provide meaningful and detailed information about the energy performance and greenhouse gas emissions of the residential stock. The information can be, for instance, used in various hot spot analyses. Additionally, the impacts of energy efficiency measures and behavioral changes can be assessed. These types of analysis can be useful for policy makers in order to prioritize actions cost efficiently, such as carrying out renovations in the residential sector. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Automated generation of optimised building envelope: simulation based multi-objective process using evolutionary algorithm
PY  - 2014
AU  - Yi, H.
AB  - This paper seeks to investigate methodology on the seamless integration for constructing a climate-conscious building envelope. The focus is targeted to provide architectural designers with an intelligent way to develop their design alternatives in the early phase of a project. Improved environmental performance can be achieved by using an optimised building envelope based on local data analysis. For tight integration, coupling of MATLAB and Rhino was employed through coding for real-time information exchanges. EnergyPlus and ECOTECT were implemented in the modelling process to simulate environmental performance. This process considers two cost functions: solar radiation and energy. Respective performance check-up runs into Multi-Objective Programming (MOP). Decision-making in MOP is optimised by using an Evolutionary Algorithm (EA), and culminated with Pareto efficiency. A sample experiment was conducted to test the methodology and results. The city, Moscow, having a conflicting claim of energy use reduction and increment of solar radiation due to its frigid local weather, was selected. Variants of adapted forms in the urban setting were visualised though the EA process in Rhino, and finalised to each dissimilar objective. The Pareto frontier method compromised the final models which were fitted best to energy and solar radiation each. The result shows how a form of building envelope can be adapted in a specific local context. This procedure serves to put forward a new user-oriented methodology and its application, intensifying the practical viability of performance-based building design in the future. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - Building energy modelling is often used in US home energy audits to assess a home's energy performance and to determine energy-efficiency retrofit recommendations. These models promise quantitative, engineering-based, defensible information on a home's energy retrofit opportunities. Modelling is based on assumed standard use behaviours, despite highly variable energy use practices. This research reports on tests that incorporate household behaviour in home energy audit modelling, based on a sample of single-family households that received a utility-sponsored home energy audit in Seattle, Washington, a US city with a cool temperate climate. The use of a compact set of self-reported behaviours in place of standardized behavioural assumptions improved the match between actual home energy consumption and model estimates, and shifted retrofit savings predictions. These were modest improvements over the initially poor match, but highlight the opportunity for better customizing home energy audit modelling by using simple information on household behaviours. A comparison of modelled savings of heating-related conservation actions shows that energy savings from moderate behavioural changes are on par with retrofits for many homes. These steps provide a gateway to modelling household behavioural changes alongside retrofits, and a means to bring behaviour into conversations with homeowners and into the technically oriented efficiency paradigm in general. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - Building-integrated photovoltaic-thermal (BIPV/T) systems with unglazed transpired solar collectors (UTCs) can provide a key solution for on-site electricity and thermal energy generation. Although the energy saving potential of this technology is significant, no systematic thermal analysis model has been developed for optimal system design and integration with building operation. This paper is the first of two companion papers focused on modeling and performance analysis of BIPV/T systems with UTC. In Part 1, energy models are presented for two configurations: UTC only and UTC with PV panels, to predict the cavity exit air temperature and plate surface temperature with weather (incident solar radiation, ambient air temperature, dew point temperature and wind speed) and design (airflow rate or suction velocity and geometry) parameters used as inputs. Nusselt number and effectiveness correlations, representing both the exterior and interior convective heat transfer processes, have been obtained from experimentally validated, three-dimensional, Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS), Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations, using high resolution grids and the ReNormalization Group Methods k-. ε (RNG k-. ε) turbulence closure model. The energy models were validated with measurements in an outdoor test-facility. Good agreement was observed between the model prediction and the experimental data, with the root mean square error (RMSE) being within 1. °C for the UTC-only model and within 2. °C for the model of UTC with PV modules. In the companion paper, Part 2, the effects of important parameters on system performance are demonstrated based on information from the literature and simulations using CFD and energy models. The optimal geometry is investigated for both configurations and the performance curves, under different levels of solar radiation, wind speed and suction velocity, are presented to provide guidelines for system design. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In the last years, solar photovoltaic (PV) systems have had great impetus with research and demonstration projects, both in Italy and other European countries. The main problems with solar PV are the cost of solar electricity, which is still higher compared with other renewables (such as wind or biomass), due to the cost of semi-conductors, and the low conversion efficiency. However, PV panel prices are rapidly decreasing benefiting from favorable economies of scale. For instance, according to the Energy Information Administration (EIA) the US average levelized costs for plants entering service in the 2018 should be 144.3$/MW h for solar PV, whereas 111.0$/MW h for biomass and 86.6$/MW h for wind (Levelized Cost of New Generation Resources in the Annual Energy Outlook, 2013). In order to increase the electric yield of PV modules (which can be even doubled with respect to constant tilt configurations), without significantly increasing the system costs, it was decided to consider the addition of inclined mirrors at both sides of the PV modules, so as to deflect more solar rays towards them, as in Mirror-Augmented Photovoltaic (MAPV) systems. The system preserves its constructive simplicity with commercial flat PV modules even though dual axis tracker must be implemented, since MAPV systems harness mainly the direct radiation. The performance analysis of MAPV systems starts from the calculation of the global irradiation on the surface of the PV module which is a sum of the direct sunlight on it and the irradiation reflected by the mirrors. A mathematical model of a MAPV system is presented, which takes into account not only the increase of direct (or beam) radiation, due to the mirrors, but also the reduction of both the diffuse and reflected radiations due to the shadowing effect of the flat mirrors. In particular, under an isotropic sky assumption, a simplified analytical expression, applicable in the case of MAPV systems, for the sky-view factor has been developed. The deterioration in the performance of the PV system as a result of the increasing cell temperature with radiation augmentation due to mirrors has been also evaluated. Moreover, in order to provide a more realistic view of the process, the energy analysis is accompanied by the exergy analysis. Finally, in order to analyse the economics of MAPV systems, Net Present Value, Discounted Payback Period, Internal Rate of Return and Life-Cycle Costs, have been considered and compared with both a constant tilt building-integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) system and a system with a dual axis tracker. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This paper describes the methodology developed and the calculation steps used to evaluate the energy efficiency potential of office buildings. The methodology enables a detailed analysis of retrofit options for the building envelope and its energy supply system. Different simplification measures accelerate the data acquisition process for office building stock owners and allow a data handling according to the existing building information, thus enabling office building structures to be prompted to design typical building constructions. We implement solutions enabling both a time-saving accelerated data input for office buildings and the handling of incomplete data. An automated calculation of the most common refurbishment measures allows a comparison of up to 64 combinations of measures, the illustration of energy and CO2 savings, and an economic evaluation. The latter takes into account the time value of money, the uncertainty of future energy prices, and the possibility of delaying an investment. To this end, a net present value analysis and a real options analysis are implemented, enabling a comparison of retrofit alternatives with different initial and future cash flows both for buildings occupied by the investor (owner-occupier perspective) and for rented buildings (tenant perspective). Energy price scenarios as well as a Monte Carlo simulation account for the uncertainty in energy price trends. For a university building used as a test case, the simplified and time-saving data input methods were successfully tested and an automated evaluation of 64 typical retrofit combinations carried out. The results of the energy, ecological and economic efficiency evaluation shows that a generally preferred retrofit option cannot always be identified. Specifically, for the test case, the best-rated economic refurbishment possibility leads to the largest increase in final energy demand amongst all options considered, which points out the necessity of a multi-criteria evaluation. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Thermal comfort is one of the main driving factors in defining the operational settings of HVAC systems, and it greatly impacts energy efficiency in buildings. Lack of information about human related variables results in using unrepresentative operational settings, which in turn could bring about low efficiency in HVAC operations. In this paper, the implementation and evaluation of a framework that integrates building occupants' personalized thermal profiles into the HVAC control logic is presented. The framework enables occupants to communicate their preferences for indoor thermal conditions through a user interface, leveraging a participatory sensing approach. The framework learns occupants' comfort profiles, using a fuzzy predictive model, and controls the HVAC system using a complementary control strategy, which enables the framework to be implemented in existing centrally controlled HVAC systems with minimum intrusion. Evaluation of the framework in a real building setting showed user comfort improvement. Moreover, the results showed a 39% reduction in daily average airflow when the HVAC system conditions the rooms at occupants' desired temperatures. Airflow is proportional to the energy consumption of HVAC system components. Consequently, the implementation of the framework shows improvements in the efficiency of the HVAC system's performance for centrally controlled office buildings. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Buildings in the 21st century are faced with the issues of extreme climate and energy saving/carbon reduction. Currently all countries realise that buildings are large consumers of energy during their life cycle. The United Nations initiated 'Global Green Policy'as well as 'Sustainable architecture and building initiative' that are related to the use of resources in buildings. These policies strive for goals 'zero-resource buildings' and 'building resource regulating'. Because of this, many countries have developed various building resource codes in dealing with building resource demand, thus gradually using energy-saving materials and equipment and alternative renewable green resources to coordinate with industry development. This includes actions such as mandatory design standards, green procurement policies and incentive subsidies and tax break policies. This research is directed towards existing buildings in the Kaohsiung area (over 90%). It uses planning design analysis of existing building outer shell energy-saving design transformation. By using data collection and choosing townhouses in Kaohsiung city (representative case), we use a building energy simulation in a building information model (BIM) to carry out efficiency analysis and simulation of exterior energy-saving transformation. By using simulation estimates for verification, the results integrate a building environmental efficiency model (EEM) and evaluate its life cycle cost and efficiency (LCCE). Research results can act as a reference for sustainable building design transformation principles.

TI  - BIM execution planning in green building projects: LEED as a use case
PY  - 2014
AU  - Wu, W.
AU  - Issa, R.R.A.
AB  - Companies that embrace both building information modeling (BIM) and green building are making conscientious efforts to pursue the synergies between the two, namely the green BIM practice. When done right, project teams find that green BIM can improve project outcomes, and facilitate the accomplishment of established sustainability goals. Nevertheless, green BIM remains an emerging trend to the majority of the industry, and its full potential is yet to be explored according to recent market research reports. The hypothesis of this research is that for companies to succeed in practicing green BIM, a holistic approach that strategically plans for BIM execution in green building projects is needed. The BIM project execution planning guidelines (PEPG) is widely adopted today to offer general guidance and standardized workflow of strategic BIM implementation. PEPG is not meant to and lacks the specificity to address green building projects in particular. However, the popularity of PEPG is conceived as an opportunity for this research to inherit its framework and create a special case of its implementation in green building projects. Considering the prevalence of leadership in energy and environmental design (LEED) green building rating system in global green building industry, this research is further refined to focus on LEED projects as an exemplary use case. Two major activities conducted include: (1) a comprehensive literature review of existing green BIM strategies and best practices; and (2) the proposition of an integrated green BIM process map (IGBPM), which is essentially adapting and further developing relevant process maps from PEPG and initiatives such as the architecture, engineering, construction, owner and operator, phase 1 (AECOO-1) joint testbed to address unique business processes of implementing BIM in LEED projects. The deliverables of this research include level 1 IGBPM and examples of level 2 IGBPM process maps, discussed along with case studies for verification and validation. The goal of this research is to create a prototype that facilitates holistic and systematic green BIM practices based upon clearly defined business processes and execution planning. © 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB  - Modern building design process is becoming more complex. Local conditions and future constructions are computer-simulated. The aim of this simulation is to evaluate theoretical RE potential for the successful and efficient exploitation of the new building. As usual, in the simulation process of local conditions, the assessment of the renewable energy potential is one of the key elements. This article presents and analyses the idea of the quantitative evaluation of renewable energy (RE) theoretical potential of the building site and the approach on how to prepare initial data file for further process of site energy development concept creation. The study describes a building site that is undergoing the RE evaluation in terms of thermodynamic and descriptive statistics characteristics. The applicability of the offered approach was verified in the case study. The specified evaluation of the combined energy fluctuation throughout the year provides new and potentially crucial information about the issues of the RE hybrid energy transformation systems modelling and about the efficient use of resources to ensure the same level of energy services.

AB  - Recently, as increasing the building energy consumption according to climate change, energy efficiency is getting worse. In response to that, increasing of the building energy efficiency and reducing of power usage are prevented a blackout by the control system of urban unit using the integration management platform. This paper presents optimization operation technique of the building energy using the control monitor based the Building Information Modeling (BIM) for the efficient operation of the integration control system. BIM is one of the approaches that can be solved by visual representation of the building and quickly interchanging of that’s information. The building energy control system should have to explain the data that results from many building information efficiently, and the operator maintaining it could have to acquire the results of the data for handling it promptly. It could suggest the forecasting of improving whole energy performance, reducing operating costs, and reducing the environmental impact associated with energy consumption, which is controlled to maximize the building energy efficiency by BAS. © 2014 Research India Publications.

AB  - Efficient systems for high performance buildings are required to improve the integration of renewable energy sources and to reduce primary energy consumption from fossil fuels. This paper is focused on sensible heat thermal energy storage (SHTES) systems using solid media and numerical simulation of their transient behavior using the finite element method (FEM). Unlike other papers in the literature, the numerical model and simulation approach has simultaneously taken into consideration various aspects: thermal properties at high temperature, the actual geometry of the repeated storage element and the actual storage cycle adopted. High-performance thermal storage materials from the literatures have been tested and used here as reference benchmarks. Other materials tested are lightweight concretes with recycled aggregates and a geopolymer concrete. Their thermal properties have been measured and used as inputs in the numerical model to preliminarily evaluate their application in thermal storage. The analysis carried out can also be used to optimize the storage system, in terms of thermal properties required to the storage material. The results showed a significant influence of the thermal properties on the performances of the storage elements. Simulation results have provided information for further scale-up from a single differential storage element to the entire module as a function of material thermal properties. © 2014 by the authors.

AB  - Energy-efficient retrofitting of existing buildings is a key aspect for reaching the proposed energy consumption reduction targets fixed by public authorities in different countries. For this task, the availability of as-built building models is of primary importance for both diagnosis of thermal dispersion and designing of retrofitting. In this paper, we present an automated methodology to derive highly detailed 3D vector models of existing building façades starting from terrestrial laser scanning data. The presented methodology first accomplishes the segmentation of the point cloud of a building façade into its planar elements. Then, starting from the identified planar clusters, façade breaklines are automatically extracted to be used later to generate a 3D vector model. During this final step, some priors on urban scenes like the prevalence of straight lines and orthogonal intersections are exploited to set additional constraints. The final product is a semantically enriched 3D model of the building façade that can be integrated in Building Information Model (BIM) for planned maintenance. Eventually, the integration between derived façade models and infrared thermography (IRT) is presented for energy efficiency evaluation of buildings and detection of thermal anomalies. © Società Italiana di Fotogrammetria e Topografia (SIFET) 2011.

AB  - During the last decade, global interest according to energy efficiency and climate change has dramatically increased. In particular, the building sector plays an important role, as it accounts for significant percentages of total energy consumption. So numerous high energy efficiency devices have been developed and applied to building. But it is also important that such high energy efficiency equipment is operated through efficient management. In this paper, through establishing a Building Energy Management System (BEMS) in the test-beds, the energy consumption and environmental data are measured and gathered at a total operation center. The proposed energy saving technologies would integrate real-time energy consumption monitoring with Building Energy Information Modeling (BEIM). To find an optimal energy-saving method, a building energy simulation was used with Genetic Algorithms. The Heating Ventilating and Air-Conditioning (HVAC) control schedules were sought. The energy-saving effect of this method is about 9.44%. HVAC control schedules can be applied to building, using a function to control facilities in buildings. This energy-saving effect will be added to the general saving effects for BEMS. It is expected that the proposed energy optimization tool using BEIM will be applied to the micro-energy grid system for smart city in the near future. © 2014 Korean Society for Precision Engineering and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - We develop safe protocols (SPs) to control ensembles of thermostatically controlled loads (TCLs) in order to provide power pulses to the grid without a subsequent oscillatory response. Such pulses can alleviate power fluctuations by intermittent resources and maintain balance between generation and demand. Building on a prior work [1], we introduce timers to endpoint TCL control enabling better shaping of power pulses. We demonstrate that such an upgrade can be used to create new safe protocols and enable load following applications with response at minute time scales. The advantage of this strategy is the use of only minimal aggregate information about a TCL ensemble and no need for additional control of TCLs to alleviate unwanted power oscillations. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The economic and environmental benefits of building retrofits have been acknowledged. However, there is a series of barriers that threaten to impede implementing successful retrofit projects such as: lack of funding, lack of interoperability, and unstructured decision making. This paper aims to address these barriers by providing the framework of the Virtual Retrofit Model (VRM), an affordable computational platform that supports streamlined decision making for building retrofit projects. An occupant survey was implemented to identify the primary requirements and perceptions from different types of stakeholders of the buildings. The responses were analyzed to identify the most important criteria of the future retrofit projects to focus on if it were to be renovated in the future. A case study approach was used to describe the outcomes from a year-long demonstration project that has been conducted at an aging commercial building. The research activities focused on integrating theories and technologies of Building Information Modeling (BIM), energy simulation, agent-based modeling, multi-criteria decision support system, and software application that can be employed and adopted in building retrofit projects. The software prototype is designed to connect buildings to a smart grid environment where building energy data should be shared for intelligent decision making. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This paper presents the Energy IN TIME (EIT) project that is aimed to develop a Smart Energy Simulation Based Control method to reduce the energy consumption and energy bill in the operational stage of existing non-residential buildings. The concept that lies behind the Energy IN TIME approach is the use of more accurate building simulation models able to represent buildings' complexity and uncertainties for building control and operation while generating forecasted information. The project goes beyond existing building control techniques, mainly demand-response based, developing an integrated control & operation approach that will combine the state of the art modelling techniques and simulation software. Energy IN TIME integrated solution will be validated on a number of existing buildings where the service will be provided. These buildings will be in different Europe locations with different climates.

AB  - According to the European Buildings Directive for the Energy Performance of Buildings 2010/31/EU [1] all new public buildings must correspond to the nearly zero energy standard from 2018 and all other new buildings from 2020. Furthermore, sustainable design and evaluation according to established certification systems such as the German Sustainable Building Certificate (DGNB), the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) or the Building Research Establishment Environmental Assessment Method (BREEAM) is more and more requested by investors for buildings and entire neighbourhood developments. In order, to meet these requirements and to ensure a high quality of the building, project teams pursue a holistic life-cycle approach to optimize buildings and neighbourhoods. In order to support this optimization process, an Integrated Virtual Energy Laboratory (IVEL) was developed during the EU research project Holistic Energy Efficiency Simulation and Lifecycle Management Of Public Use Facilities (09/2010-12/2013 HESMOS) and will be further developed in the EU research project Collaborative Holistic Design Laboratory and Methodology for energy-efficient Embedded Buildings (eeEmbedded 10/2013-09/2017).© 2014 Ernst & Sohn Verlag für Architektur und technische Wissenschaften GmbH & Co.

AB  - Solar thermal systems are widely used in China, but the actual application is irregularly, lacking in adaptability analysis in different regions. Based on multiple attribute decision making methods (MADM) and GIS technology, the adaptability evaluation model of solar thermal system was established on energy efficiency, economy and social environment. Analytic hierarchy process and expert consultation method were used to determine the weight of evaluation index, effectively providing tools for regional adaptability evaluation. Choosing a solar hot water system in residential building as an example, a comprehensive evaluation of 31 provincial capitals in China was carried out depending on capital city conditions such as climate, resources and economy. The results show that there is an obviously geographical difference in the adaptability of solar hot water system. The adaptability evaluation of conditions are classified into four patterns, there are five districts for 1 class area, twelve districts for 2 class area, ten districts for 3 class area and four districts for 4 class area. Many factors influence the application of solar hot water system, such as solar energy resource endowments, economic levels, social and environmental benefits. Local government should combine with their own specific conditions and adaptability types to promote solar thermal application.

TI  - Implementing 'BEAM Plus' for BIM-based sustainability analysis
PY  - 2014
AU  - Wong, J.K.-W.
AU  - Kuan, K.-L.
AB  - Escalating energy costs and the need to improve energy efficiency have increased public awareness of the need to reduce energy consumption over a building's entire lifecycle, and have prompted efforts to integrate green and sustainable building initiatives into the conventional building design, construction and operation processes. Sustainable building rating systems are being increasingly adopted to assess the sustainability performance of building design and construction. Building information modelling (BIM)-based technologies are regarded as a potentially useful vehicle for helping project stakeholders to capture complete design and project information, and to make the best use of the available design data for sustainable design and sustainability rating analysis. While experience from the Leadership in Environmental Energy and Design (LEED) programme in the US has demonstrated the great potential of integrating BIM with building assessments, it is anticipated that BIM can also be effectively integrated with the Hong Kong 'BEAM Plus' sustainable building rating system. This study uses a two-stage method (i.e. a Delphi study and a case study) to explore the potential use of BIM in the case of a residential building project seeking BEAM Plus sustainable building certification in Hong Kong. The Delphi study indicated that 26 out of 80 credit points could potentially be achieved with the support of the documentation produced by BIM (i.e. Autodesk Revit). Detailed procedures for conducting and testing a BIM-based BEAM Plus sustainability analysis are described. The proposed BIM-BEAM Plus assessment framework is then verified using two sampled public housing modular flat models. The complexity of the BIM-BEAM Plus application depends on the project size, the extent of the model development detail and the nature of the project. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - A BIM-enabled information infrastructure for building energy Fault Detection and Diagnostics
PY  - 2014
AU  - Dong, B.

AU  - Li, Z.
AB  - Although energy-efficient building technologies are emerging, a key challenge is how to effectively maintain building energy performance over the evolving lifecycle of the building. Field experience shows that energy savings of 5-30% are typically achievable simply by applying energy Fault Detection and Diagnostics (FDD) and correcting faults diagnosed in buildings. Model-based FDD in buildings is a challenging task, not only because the task itself is difficult, but also because the workflow and information exchange behind the task is very complex and error prone. This complexity arises from several aspects. Firstly, creating a baseline building energy performance model suitable for FDD is both time and labor consuming. Secondly, the FDD module typically has its own ad-hoc platform, and the integration of this platform with the existing Building Energy Management System (BEMS) is technically challenging due to the incompatible interoperability. Finally, the information exchange itself is complex due to the existence of multiple functioning modules to make FDD workflow happen. To perform an efficient and effective FDD with the BEMS in buildings, information is needed to flow among an as-built building static information module, a building energy performance simulation module, a building operational data acquisition module and a FDD module. In such a complex process, it is challenging to ensure the information integrity and consistence. In this paper, we propose a Building Information Modeling (BIM) enabled information infrastructure for FDD, which streamlines the information exchange process and therefore has the potential to improve the efficiency of similar works in practice. The proposed information infrastructure was deployed and implemented in a real building for a FDD case study.

TI  - Electrical signal source separation via nonnegative tensor factorization using on site measurements in a smart home

AU  - Figueiredo, M.

AB  - Measuring the electrical consumption of individual appliances in a household has recently received renewed interest in the area of energy efficiency research and sustainable development. The unambiguous acquisition of information by a single monitoring point of the whole house's electrical signal is known as energy disaggregation or nonintrusive load monitoring. A novel way to look into the issue of energy disaggregation is to interpret it as a single-channel source separation problem. To this end, we analyze the performance of source modeling based on multiway arrays and the corresponding decomposition or tensor factorization. First, with the proviso that a tensor composed of the data for the several devices in the house is given, nonnegative tensor factorization is performed in order to extract the most relevant components. Second, the outcome is later embedded in the test step, where only the measured consumption over the whole home is available. Finally, the disaggregated data by the device is obtained by factorizing the associated matrix considering the learned models. In this paper, we compare this method with a recent approach based on sparse coding. The results are obtained using real-world data from household electrical consumption measurements. The analysis of the comparison results illustrates the relevance of the multiway array-based approach in terms of accurate disaggregation, as further endorsed by the statistical analysis performed. © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - Using both measured and modelling data, the hygrothermal environment in a national gallery was examined to envisage the buildings response to weather conditions, occupancy and HVAC operations. The measured data were acquired from the BMS system and purposely fitted monitoring instruments. The data was also used to validate a specially developed dynamic thermal model, which was then used in a series of simulations in a parametric study. The simulations ran under nine designed cases to test a number of low energy solutions proposed in a gallery renovation project, namely upgrading skylights, adding roof insulation, and applying an adaptable environmental control strategy. Through this systematic analysis and quantitative comparisons this study intends to provide reliable information for decision making for the renovation work to ensure an optimal solution and best results. This study was benefited by a close collaboration between the physicist, computer modeller, building manager and gallery conservationist. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In this paper, a conceptual framework that couples energy modeling with occupancy characteristics and energy use data is developed and tested to achieve two main objectives: (1) couple distinct and spatially distributed simulation models and synchronize their data exchange, and (2) illustrate the coupled model behavior through a hypothetical case study example of a building. This conceptual framework is developed using a distributed computing environment based on the principles defined in the high-level architecture (HLA). Thus, individual simulation models and control interfaces developed for their own purpose, called federates, are composed and coupled together in an HLA-compliant federation that allows federates to continuously communicate with one another and exchange relevant information at each time step to achieve the global objective of reducing the building's energy use. A case study example of a typical commercial building illustrates how the model coordinates data synchronization and transfer between federates, which run simultaneously in a distributed fashion. This example tests the effect of energy intervention scenarios, namely, feedback frequency to building occupants on the building's energy use, and it illustrates the potential application of the framework to study energy interventions in buildings. © 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.

TI  - How much information disclosure of building energy performance is necessary?
PY  - 2014
AU  - Hsu, D.
AB  - Many different governments have begun to require disclosure of building energy performance, in order to allow owners and prospective buyers to incorporate this information into their investment decisions. These policies, known as disclosure or information policies, require owners to benchmark their buildings and sometimes conduct engineering audits. However, given substantial variation in the cost to disclose different types of information, it is natural to ask: how much and what kind of information about building energy performance should be disclosed, and for what purposes? To answer this question, this paper assembles and cleans a comprehensive panel dataset of New York City multifamily buildings, and analyzes its predictive power using a Bayesian multilevel regression model. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) reveals that building-level variation is the most important factor in explaining building energy use, and that there are few, if any, relationships of building systems to observed energy use. This indicates that disclosure laws requiring benchmarking data may be relatively more useful than engineering audits in explaining the observed energy performance of existing buildings. These results should inform the further development of information disclosure laws. © 2013 The Author.

The UK government's Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC) is engaged in a programme of new research to update this evidence base. The work has two main components. The first is a database - the National Energy Efficiency Data framework (NEED) - in which floor area and activity data for non-domestic premises are being linked to electricity and gas consumption at the individual property level. The second is a research project of sample surveys designed to elicit information about buildings and energy use, but also opportunities for abatement and the behavioural and organizational factors affecting efficiency improvements. A pilot survey of the food and mixed retail sector has been carried out in advance of further surveys of the entire range of building types. The research programme is described along with some of the methodological problems it raises. © Crown Copyright 2013.

AB  - With building energy consumption rising in industrial nations, new approaches for energy efficiency are required. Similarly, the data centers that house information and communications technology continue to consume significant amounts of energy, especially for cooling the equipment, which in turn produces vast amounts of waste heat. A new strategy to overcome these challenges is called environmentally opportunistic computing (EOC), which conceptualizes the data center as a series of distributed heat providers (nodes) for other-purposed buildings that use the waste heat from the data center nodes to offset their own heating costs. In this paper, a general framework for evaluating the deployment of EOC is developed and select model cases are analyzed. The results show that by redefining a centralized data center as distributed nodes across multiple buildings, the overall energy consumption of an organization decreases significantly. The advantages of applying EOC to buildings that require constant water heat as opposed to seasonal space heat are explained, and the method of distributing the computational load among data center nodes is evaluated.© 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Standardization is one of the pillars of interoperability. In this context, efforts promoted by the Open Geospatial Consortium, such as CityGML (Technical University, Berlin), a standard for exchanging three-dimensional models or urban city objects, are welcomed. However, information from other domains of interest (e.g. energy efficiency or building information modeling) is needed for tasks such as land planning, large-scale flooding analysis, or demand/supply energy simulations. CityGML allows extension in order to integrate information from other domains, but the development process is expensive because there is no way to perform it automatically. The discovery of correspondences between CityGML concepts and other domains concepts poses a significant challenge.Ontology matching is the research field emerged from the Semantic Web to address automatic ontology integration. Using the ontology underlying CityGML and the ontologies which model other domains of interest, ontology matching would be able to find the correspondences that would permit the integration in a more automatic manner than it is done now.In this paper, we evaluate if ontology matching techniques allow performing an automatic integration of geospatial information modeled from different viewpoints. In order to achieve this, an evaluation methodology was designed, and it was applied to the discovery of relationships between CityGML and ontologies coming from the building information modeling and Geospatial Semantic Web domains. The methodology and the results of the evaluation are presented. The best results have been achieved using string-based techniques, while matching systems give the worst precision and recall. Only in a few cases the values are over 50%, which shows the limitations when these techniques are applied to ontologies with a partial overlap. © 2013 © Taylor & Francis.

TI  - Technology variation vs. R&D uncertainty: What matters most for energy patent success?
PY  - 2013

AU  - Santen, N.

AU  - Webster, M.
AB  - R&D is an uncertain activity with highly skewed outcomes. Nonetheless, most recent empirical studies and modeling estimates of the potential of technological change focus on the average returns to research and development (R&D) for a composite technology and contain little or no information about the distribution of returns to R&D - which could be important for capturing the range of costs associated with climate change mitigation policies - by individual technologies. Through an empirical study of patent citation data, this paper adds to the literature on the outcomes of energy R&D by focusing on the behavior of the most successful innovations for six energy technologies, allowing us to determine whether uncertainty or differences in technologies matter most for success. We highlight two key results. First, we compare the results from an aggregate analysis of six energy technologies to technology-by-technology results. Our results show that existing work that assumes diminishing returns but assumes one generic technology is too simplistic and misses important differences between more successful and less successful technologies. Second, we use quantile regression techniques to learn more about patents that have a high positive error term in our regressions - that is, patents that receive many more citations than predicted based on observable characteristics. We find that differences across technologies, rather than differences across quantiles within technologies, are more important. The value of successful technologies persists longer than those of less successful technologies, providing evidence that success is the culmination of several advances building upon one another, rather than resulting from one single breakthrough. Diminishing returns to research activities appear most problematic during rapid increases of research investment, such as experienced by solar energy in the 1970s. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In this paper, we report a methodology, developed in the context of Smart Energy Efficient Middleware for Public Spaces European Project, aimed at exploiting ICT monitoring and control services to reduce energy usage and CO2 footprint in existing buildings. The approach does not require significant construction work as it is based on commercial-off-the-shelf devices and, where present, it exploits and integrates existing building management systems with new sensors and actuator networks. To make this possible, the proposed approach leverages upon the following main contributions: (a) to develop an integrated building automation and control system, (b) to implement a middleware for the energy-efficient buildings domain, (c) to provide a multi-dimensional building information modelling-based visualisation, and (d) to raise people's awareness about energy efficiency. The research approach adopted in the project started with the selection, as case studies, of representative test and reference rooms in modern and historical buildings chosen for having different requirements and constraints in term of sensing and control technologies. Then, according to the features of the selected rooms, the strategies to reduce the energy consumptions were defined, taking into account the potential savings related to lighting, heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems and other device loads (PC, printers, etc.). The strategies include both the control of building services and devices and the monitoring of environmental conditions and energy consumption. In the paper, the energy savings estimated through simulation, for both HVAC and lighting, are presented to highlight the potential of the designed system. After the implementation of the system in the demonstrator, results will be compared with the monitored data. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - Energy efficiency of buildings is gaining increasing importance not only from the economic perspective but from the environment perspective as well. This paper deals with the development of Energy modelling to achieve energy efficiency in an Information Technology (IT) park in Chennai. Energy modelling is a computer simulated model that analyzes the building's energyrelated features in order to project energy consumption of a given design. It is the most comprehensive solution to develop a good energy model for the integration of Heating Ventilation and Air conditioning (HVAC), lighting system and building envelope. The availability of the 3D visualisation systems has enabled the designers to find the desirable results required for optimum energy consumption. The results of the simulation is available in the form of load breakup, annual energy consumption and the breakdown of energy consumption, which can be categorized zone wise, system wise or equipment wise. The outcome of this study will help all the decision makers to design better energy efficient buildings and protect environment by preserving natural resources. © Research India Publications.

TI  - A dwelling-level investigation into the physical and socio-economic drivers of domestic energy consumption in England
PY  - 2013
AU  - Wyatt, P.
AB  - The UK Government's Department for Energy and Climate Change has been investigating the feasibility of developing a national energy efficiency data framework covering both domestic and non-domestic buildings. Working closely with the Energy Saving Trust and energy suppliers, the aim is to develop a data framework to monitor changes in energy efficiency, develop and evaluate programmes and improve information available to consumers. Key applications of the framework are to understand trends in built stock energy use, identify drivers and evaluate the success of different policies. For energy suppliers, it could identify what energy uses are growing, in which sectors and why. This would help with market segmentation and the design of products. For building professionals, it could supplement energy audits and modelling of end-use consumption with real data and support the generation of accurate and comprehensive benchmarks. This paper critically examines the results of the first phase of work to construct a national energy efficiency data-framework for the domestic sector focusing on two specific issues: (a) drivers of domestic energy consumption in terms of the physical nature of the dwellings and socio-economic characteristics of occupants and (b) the impact of energy efficiency measures on energy consumption. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Pollutant dispersion in a natural ventilated dental clinic
PY  - 2013
AU  - Zhang, W.

AU  - Wong, H.M.
AB  - Mechanical ventilation poses some challenges for control of pollutants in a fully enclosed dental clinic. Natural ventilation is used in some clinics because of its high exhausting efficiency and low non-renewable energy consumption. In this study, a dental clinic model was built using a computational fluid dynamics platform. The objective was to study the effect of natural ventilation on pollutant dispersion in this setting. The evaluations were conducted using the advanced turbulence model, large eddy simulation for the flow field and the discrete phase modelling for pollutant tracks. Three basic ventilation paths were identified, the 'single narrow path', 'narrow path' and 'dispersive path'. The results show that the first of these had the highest efficiency, with an escape time of about 1/30 and 1/100 of the narrow and dispersive paths, respectively. Despite the position of the pollutant source and facilities such as bulkheads, escape time was significantly reduced when the ventilation flow rate was increased under the single narrow and dispersive paths. However, for the narrow path, these factors played a more dominant role in the escape time than the ventilation flow rate. Practical application: This study is expected to provide information and guidance in understanding the pollutant spread in a naturally ventilated room such as a dental clinic. © The Chartered Institution of Building Services Engineers 2012.

AB  - This paper investigates whether the intrinsic energy efficiency rating of an office building has a significant impact on its rental value. A sample of 817 transactions for offices with Energy Performance Certificates (EPCs) in the UK is used to assess whether a pricing differential can be identified, depending on the energy rating. While previous analyses of this topic have typically relied on appraisal-based and/or asking rent data, the dataset used in this research contains actual contract rents as well as information on lease terms. The results indicate a significant rental premium for energy-efficient buildings. However, it is found that this premium appears to be mainly driven by the youngest cohort of state-of-the-art energy-efficient buildings. The results also show that tenants of more energy-efficient buildings tend to pay a lower service charge, but this link appears to be rather weak and limited to newer buildings. Hence, it is argued that the information contained in the EPC is still not fully taken into account in the UK commercial property market with the possible exception of both the highest and the lowest EPC ratings. © 2013 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

TI  - Development, validation and application of a fixed district heating model structure that requires small amounts of input data

AB  - Reducing the energy use of buildings is an important part in reaching the European energy efficiency targets. Consequently, local energy systems need to adapt to a lower demand for heating. A 90% of Swedish multi-family residential buildings use district heating (DH) produced in Sweden's over 400 DH systems, which use different heat production technologies and fuels. DH system modelling results obtained until now are mostly for particular DH systems and cannot be easily generalised. Here, a fixed model structure (FMS) based on linear programming for cost-optimisaton studies of DH systems is developed requiring only general DH system information. A method for approximating heat demands based on local outdoor temperature data is also developed. A scenario is studied where the FMS is applied to six Swedish DH systems and heat demands are reduced due to energy efficiency improvements in buildings. The results show that the FMS is a useful tool for DH system optimisation studies and that building energy efficiency improvements lead to reduced use of fossil fuels and biomass in DH systems. Also, the share of CHP in the production mix is increased in five of the six DH systems when the heat demand is reduced. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - A method for predicting city-wide electricity gains from photovoltaic panels based on LiDAR and GIS data combined with hourly Daysim simulations

AU  - Jakubiec, J.A.

AB  - In this paper we present, demonstrate and validate a method for predicting city-wide electricity gains from photovoltaic panels based on detailed 3D urban massing models combined with Daysim-based hourly irradiation simulations, typical meteorological year climactic data and hourly calculated rooftop temperatures. The resulting data can be combined with online mapping technologies and search engines as well as a financial module that provides building owners interested in installing a photovoltaic system on their rooftop with meaningful data regarding spatial placement, system size, installation costs and financial payback. As a proof of concept, a photovoltaic potential map for the City of Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA, consisting of over 17,000 rooftops has been implemented as of September 2012.The new method constitutes the first linking of increasingly available GIS and LiDAR urban datasets with the validated building performance simulation engine Daysim, thus-far used primarily at the scale of individual buildings or small urban neighborhoods. A comparison of the new method with its predecessors reveals significant benefits as it produces hourly point irradiation data, supports better geometric accuracy, considers reflections from near by urban context and uses predicted rooftop temperatures to calculate hourly PV efficiency. A validation study of measured and simulated electricity yields from two rooftop PV installations in Cambridge shows that the new method is able to predict annual electricity gains within 3.6-5.3% of measured production when calibrating for actual weather data and detailed PV panel geometry. This predicted annual error using the new method is shown to be less than the variance which can be expected from climactic variation between years. Furthermore, because the new method generates hourly data, it can be applied to peak load mitigation studies at the urban level. This study also compares predicted monthly energy yields using the new method to those of preceding methods for the two validated test installations and on an annual basis for 10 buildings selected randomly from the Cambridge dataset. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Danish fishermen have provided information on dynamics in their fuel consumption, running costs, and fishing patterns through a web-based questionnaire. This detailed documentation of the fishing practices is used in spatial modelling tools to improve advice and research for fisheries. The tools integrate detailed information on vessel distribution, catch and fuel consumption for different fisheries with a detailed resource distribution of targeted stocks from research surveys to evaluate the optimum consumption and efficiency to reduce fuel costs and the costs of displacement of effort. The energy efficiency for the value of catch per unit of fuel consumed is analysed by merging the questionnaire, logbook and VMS (vessel monitoring system) information. Logic decision trees and conditional behaviour probabilities are established from the responses of fishermen regarding a range of sequential hypothetical conditions influencing their trip decisions, covering the duration of fishing time, choice of fishing ground(s), when to stop fishing and return to port, and the choice of the port for landing. Fleet-based energy and economy efficiency are linked to the decision (choice) dynamics. Larger fuel-intensive but efficient vessels conducting pelagic or industrial fishing are more inclined to base their decision on fish price only, while numerous smaller and less efficient vessels conducting demersal mixed or crustacean fishery usually consider other flexible factors, e.g., the potential for a large catch, weather, previous knowledge and experience, and the distance to/from port, which affect the number and duration of trips and the fuel consumption. Integration of the results into our recently developed spatially explicit individual-based fishing vessel model (IBM) incorporate the variability and predict the adaptations of individual fishermen to resource availability dynamics, increasing fuel prices, changes in regulations, and the consequences of socioeconomic external pressures on harvested stocks. A new methodology is described here to obtain quantitative information on the fishermen's micro-scale decisions initially required. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - HVAC system operational strategies for reduced energy consumption in buildings with intermittent occupancy: The case of mosques
PY  - 2013
AU  - Budaiwi, I.
AU  - Abdou, A.
AB  - Mosques are places of worship for Muslims with unique functional requirements and operational characteristics. They are partially or fully occupied for about an hour for five intermittent periods during the day. In hot climates, maintaining indoor thermal comfort requires a considerable amount of energy that can be reduced by proper operational zoning and effective HVAC operation strategies. The objective of this paper is to investigate the impact of operational zoning and HVAC system intermittent operation strategies on the energy performance of mosques while thermal comfort is maintained. Energy simulation modeling is used for evaluating alternative zoning and HVAC operation strategies. Results indicate that up to 23% reduction in annual cooling energy is achieved by employing suitable HVAC operation strategy and system over-sizing, and 30% reduction is achieved by appropriate operational zoning. Comparing the cooling energy consumption of HVAC summer continuous operation of an un-insulated mosque with the consumption of the insulated mosque with properly oversized HVAC system operated for 1 h during each prayer, indicated that as much as 46% of cooling energy reduction can be achieved. Furthermore, utilizing proper operational zoning and HVAC operation strategies is expected to bring about an additional significant energy reduction. Guidelines for mosque HVAC systems operation and thermal zoning are developed. These design/operation guidelines would provide a source of information for professionals to improve the thermal and energy performance of mosques. This knowledge can also contribute towards the development of future energy-related design codes for mosques. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - There is an urgent need in the architecture, engineering, and construction industries for new programs and methods of producing reliable energy simulations using building information modeling (BIM) technology. Current methods and programs for running energy simulations are not very timely, are difficult to understand, and lack high interoperability between BIM and energy simulation software. It is necessary to improve on these drawbacks as design decisions are often made without the aid of energy modeling leading to the design and construction of nonoptimized buildings with respect to energy efficiency. The goal of this research project is to develop a new methodology to produce energy estimates from a BIM model expeditiously and to improve interoperability between the simulation engine and BIM software. In the proposed methodology, the extracted information from a BIM model is compiled into an input file and run in a popular energy simulation program on an hourly basis for a desired period. The case applied in this paper showed that the application of this methodology can be used to quickly provide energy simulations from BIM models. With the aid of an easy-to-run and easily understood energy simulation methodology, designers will be able to make more energy conscious decisions during the design phase and as changes in design requirements arise. © 2013 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB  - In Flanders and the Netherlands greenhouse production systems produce economically important quantities of vegetables, fruit and ornamentals. Indoor environmental control has resulted in high primary energy use. Until now, the research on saving primary energy in greenhouse systems has been mainly based on analysis of energy balances. However, according to the thermodynamic theory, an analysis based on the concept of exergy (free energy) and energy can result in new insights and primary energy savings. Therefore in this paper, we analyse the exergy and energy of various processes, inputs and outputs of a general greenhouse system. Also a total system analysis is then performed by linking the exergy analysis with a dynamic greenhouse climate growth simulation model. The exergy analysis indicates that some processes (" Sources") lie at the origin of several other processes, both destroying the exergy of primary energy inputs. The exergy destruction of these Sources is caused primarily by heat and vapour loss. Their impact can be compensated by exergy input from heating, solar radiation, or both. If the exergy destruction of these Sources is reduced, the necessary compensation can also be reduced. This can be accomplished through insulating the greenhouse and making the building more airtight. Other necessary Sources, namely transpiration and loss of CO2, have a low exergy destruction compared to the other Sources. They are therefore the best candidate for "pump" technologies (" vapour heat pump" and "CO2 pump") designed to have a low primary energy use. The combination of these proposed technologies results in an exergy efficient greenhouse with the highest primary energy savings. It can be concluded that exergy analyses add additional information compared to only energy analyses and it supports the development of primary energy efficient greenhouse systems. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In the German electric energy market, the share of regional and decentralized power generation based on renewables has become more and more signifi cant. The following study describes the initiative of the energy and utilities company 'EnBW Energie Baden-Württemberg AG' (EnBW) in Germany to investigate regional energy concepts based on agricultural biomass. The study focuses on two aspects: the development of more sustainable approaches for energy crops cultivation and the efficient use of cogeneration heat produced by bioenergy-driven power plants in rural areas. For the development of concepts and tools, a study area including two counties in the South-West of Germany were chosen. This article focuses on the work done on the county of Ravensburg. Geographic information system (GIS) tools are used to collect data about current land use practices related to energy crops. Subsequently, the suitability of new and more sustainable energy crops for biogas production based on current production regimes is investigated by following a modeling approach. The approach followed includes the screening of new agricultural substrates as substitutes for maize, which is currently the dominant energy crop for biogas production in Germany, the modeling of new substrate mixtures, and the measurement of the methane potential of energy crop samples in a biogas laboratory. Bioenergy-driven power plants are usually implemented nearby high biomass potentials-in rural areas, where heat demand is scarce. Optimizing heat use in combined heat and power (CHP) generators is a major issue for the future of bioenergy. The effi cient utilization of residual heat is one of the targets of the upcoming update of the German Renewable Energy Sources Act in 2012. Therefore, the profi table operation of biogas plants increasingly depends on the level of heat use which can be reached. The possibilities for heat supply to potential consumers in rural areas have been investigated using a GIS methodology on an object-based level for residential and tertiary/industry sectors. Building age and type have been used as parameters to estimate the annual heat consumption. Scenarios illustrating a renovation rate of the investigated objects (buildings) have been calculated. For the purpose of verifi cation and calibration, measurements of the heat demand of more than 3,000 houses have been used. Furthermore, on the basis of existing biogas plants, a techno-economic comparison of heat networks with micro gas networks for the distribution of renewable energy to demand sites have been performed. © 2013 WIT Press.

AB  - The notion of advancing levels of adequate regulatory compliance within the domain of construction and engineering is by no means a new phenomenon. An extensive degree of effort has over a number of decades previously focused on semi/fully automating design checking against regulatory building codes. After experiencing somewhat of a dip in popularity within academia, this research topic is once again of great interest due to the on-going adoption of Building Information Modelling (BIM) within the construction domain among other drivers like frequent updates to building regulatory documents particularly in relation to sustainability related issues like energy efficiency of buildings. This interest will only increase as we witness further widespread adoption of this new BIM paradigm across until now untouched disciplines. Unfortunately design checking within the remit of BIM still faces major problems with respect to national and local regulations as no sustainably sensible or scalable method has yet been implemented to ensure compliance rules are consistent with current legislation within these contexts. This work questions a suitable representational data format for UK construction and engineering regulations focusing on machine processable formats built entirely on open data standards which can then set the basis for addressing the aforementioned issues. We compare two existing legislation data models, namely the Crown Legislation Markup Language (CLML) and Akoma Ntoso, whilst in the process grading each on its suitability for most accurately accommodating and expressing the domain and profession specific nature of typical building regulations. The study conclusions indicate that the design, management and current availability of the CLML has resulted in a scenario where barriers exist to widespread adoption, this includes building out community in support of the language. Akoma Ntoso on the other hand has focused on building community around the proposed standard. This increases the likelihood of phased organisational transition towards the standard for achieving improved representational data modelling. © 2013 The authors.

AB  - Irradiation on building vertical surfaces is a key parameter for models of building energy performance. The state of current modeling enables detailed computation of the energy balance for individual buildings. However, automating building energy performance calculations for an entire city remains a challenge due to the computational processing time and manual inputs needed to inform and execute existing models. This study presents a technique for modeling irradiance on the walls of multiple buildings by integrating spatially contiguous datasets of surrounding urban form and topography with building footprints. Point obstruction stacking, which is used to determine solar occluding features at various points across the building envelope, is validated using different configurations of point spacing. Results indicate that points spaced vertically along the edge of building walls provided the lowest error estimates of annual mean daily irradiance for both single family dwellings (RMSE: 0.84 MJ m-2 day-1) and multistory buildings (RMSE: 1.16 MJ m-2 day-1). Computational expense and application of the point obstruction stacking technique are discussed. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In this paper, we present a micro-model designed to assess the effectiveness of low-carbon policies in addressing the energy problems faced by the Chinese urban residential sector. This micro-model first evaluates CO2 emissions based on available information for the residential sector, including the number of households, floor area and domestic appliance ownership. Two efficiency scenarios are then combined to form the simulation model: Chinese government policies and the low carbon plans of OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) countries. The simulation model estimates future emissions growth and the CO2 reduction potential of two efficiency scenarios. The results indicate that when government policies align with the efforts of residents, there is opportunity to reduce CO2 emissions in Chinese residential buildings for a relatively low price. In the frozen technology scenario, data shows that in all 31 province-level divisions, CO2 emission growth will see a 10-fold increase over the 2000 level. However, when compared with the frozen technology scenario, the reduction scenario shows reductions of 20% (warm areas) to 40% (cold areas). In the abatement scenario the reduction rates could be brought up to 50%. The model's outputs can be used to support decision-making when setting appropriate CO2 emission reduction goals. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

TI  - A proposal for energy efficient design: An IFC based design decision system and its application
PY  - 2013
AU  - Turkyilmaz, E.
AB  - Today, a large part of the total energy consumed in buildings is used to provide adequate indoor air quality and indoor lighting. The dirt and noise of urban environments encourage keeping buildings closed tight, with a resultant reliance on mechanical systems. Despite tightening the building envelope to decrease energy consumption, the building itself becomes more dependent on mechanical systems and monitors to assure adequate heat, ventilation and air-conditioning. The need, amount and the timing of energy efficient air conditioning are the subjects of studies, which include how to provide efficient air conditioning to control indoor air quality. Within this context, the aim of the research is to develop a design decision system to provide sufficient and consistent knowledge on air-conditioning for the design process. Today, there are only a few systems serving the same aim with a very limited capacity. These systems are not designed to be either cost-effective or industrial applicable. Air-conditioning and air circulation analysis of spaces are made by CFD (Computer Fluid Dynamics) software. In order to use air-conditioning and air circulation analysis in design process efficiently, CFD analysis software and BIM (Building Information Modelling) software should work together. Three steps are followed to develop the proposed system. First, what the results of air circulation analysis used by architects is composed of. Second, an interface is designed to define air circulation analysis in BIM software. Third, additional properties set to Industry Foundation Classes (IFCs) standard to keep analysis data on BIM model is prepared. A computer laboratory and a conference room are chosen to test the developed system. The evaluation of preliminary test results are shown that the developed system produces easily understandable graphic analysis for architects. While using the proposed system, air conditioning is no longer a very general characteristic of a design process but it is a real design feature forming the overall design process. © 2013 WIT Press.

AB  - Building Information Modeling (BIM) for optimizing the total lifecycle cost of buildings is a challenge even today. Inadequate software interoperability, high costs as a result of the fragmented nature of the building industry, lack of standardization, inconsistent technology adoption among stakeholders are just some of the obstacles that architects and engineers face. However, optimization requires a structured procedure that enables continuous changes in design variables and assessment on energy consumption. A holistic building design and construction are already introduced in Europe through the energy performance of buildings directive (EPBD). The requirements have been strengthened by the EPBD recast for achieving cost optimal building designs for the life cycle of the building, moving towards nearly zero energy buildings by the end of the decade. BIM and intelligent services could play a crucial role in these efforts with improved visualization and productivity due to easy retrieval of information, increased coordination of data and exchange of information, all leading to a reduced cost for the design of energy efficient buildings. An ongoing European research project aims to contribute to these needs by developing a Virtual Energy Laboratory that will support building energy performance simulations taking into account the stochastic nature of input parameters and processes. This will be supported by information communication technology features utilizing the necessary computational power through cloud computing. This paper presents an overview of the ongoing efforts and focuses on results for assessing the impact of different input weather and climate data that are pertinent in building load and energy performance calculations. © Balaras et al.

TI  - Energy benchmarking of commercial buildings: A low-cost pathway toward urban sustainability
PY  - 2013
AU  - Cox, M.

AB  - US cities are beginning to experiment with a regulatory approach to address information failures in the real estate market by mandating the energy benchmarking of commercial buildings. Understanding how a commercial building uses energy has many benefits; for example, it helps building owners and tenants identify poor-performing buildings and subsystems and it enables high-performing buildings to achieve greater occupancy rates, rents, and property values. This paper estimates the possible impacts of a national energy benchmarking mandate through analysis chiefly utilizing the Georgia Tech version of the National Energy Modeling System (GT-NEMS). Correcting input discount rates results in a 4.0% reduction in projected energy consumption for seven major classes of equipment relative to the reference case forecast in 2020, rising to 8.7% in 2035. Thus, the official US energy forecasts appear to overestimate future energy consumption by underestimating investments in energy-efficient equipment. Further discount rate reductions spurred by benchmarking policies yield another 1.3-1.4% in energy savings in 2020, increasing to 2.2-2.4% in 2035. Benchmarking would increase the purchase of energy-efficient equipment, reducing energy bills, CO2 emissions, and conventional air pollution. Achieving comparable CO2 savings would require more than tripling existing US solar capacity. Our analysis suggests that nearly 90% of the energy saved by a national benchmarking policy would benefit metropolitan areas, and the policy's benefits would outweigh its costs, both to the private sector and society broadly. © 2013 IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - The envelope shape, the most salient design characteristic in a building, has significant influence on its energy performance. However, in the early design stages, when the envelope shape is defined, energy performance information is normally nonexistent, due to modeling for energy simulation being a time-consuming task, frequently overlooked at this phase. This paper presents a methodology to assist design decisions regarding the building envelope shape considering its implications on energy performance. Basically, this methodology involves a flexible design system, to generate alternative envelope shape designs, with integrated energy simulation, to calculate the energy demand of each design. Shape grammars are particularly suitable to encode architectural design systems, given their ability to encode compositional design principles. Their downside is the complexity in developing computer implementations. This methodology converts a grammar into a parametric design system and is illustrated with an application to the grammar for Frank Lloyd Wright's prairie houses. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Society is becoming increasingly aware of the impact that our lifestyle choices make on energy usage and the environment. As a result, research attention is being directed toward green technology, environmentally-friendly building designs, and smart grids. This paper looks at the user side of sustainability. In particular, it looks at energy consumption in everyday home environments to examine the relationship between behavioral patterns and energy consumption. It first demonstrates how data mining techniques may be used to find patterns and anomalies in smart home-based energy data. Next, it describes a method to correlate home-based activities with electricity usage. Finally, it describes how this information could inform users about their personal energy consumption and to support activities in a more energy-efficient manner. These approaches are validated by using real energy data collected in a set of smart home testbeds. © 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Measured mobility and current-voltage characteristics of single layer and photovoltaic (PV) devices composed of poly{9,9-dioctylfluorene-co-bis[N,N ′-(4-butylphenyl)]bis(N,N′-phenyl-1,4- phenylene)diamine} (PFB) and poly(9,9-dioctylfluorene-co-benzothiadiazole) (F8BT) have been reproduced by a mesoscopic model employing the kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) approach. Our aim is to show how to avoid the uncertainties common in electrical transport models arising from the need to fit a large number of parameters when little information is available, for example, a single current-voltage curve. Here, simulation parameters are derived from a series of measurements using a self-consistent "building-blocks" approach, starting from data on the simplest systems. We found that site energies show disorder and that correlations in the site energies and a distribution of deep traps must be included in order to reproduce measured charge mobility-field curves at low charge densities in bulk PFB and F8BT. The parameter set from the mobility-field curves reproduces the unipolar current in single layers of PFB and F8BT and allows us to deduce charge injection barriers. Finally, by combining these disorder descriptions and injection barriers with an optical model, the external quantum efficiency and current densities of blend and bilayer organic PV devices can be successfully reproduced across a voltage range encompassing reverse and forward bias, with the recombination rate the only parameter to be fitted, found to be 1×107 s-1. These findings demonstrate an approach that removes some of the arbitrariness present in transport models of organic devices, which validates the KMC as an accurate description of organic optoelectronic systems, and provides information on the microscopic origins of the device behavior. © 2012 American Physical Society.

AB  - For powering wireless sensors in buildings, rechargeable batteries may be used. These batteries will be recharged remotely by dedicated RF sources. Far-field RF energy transport is known to suffer from path loss and therefore the RF power available on the rectifying antenna or rectenna will be very low. As a consequence, the RF-to-DC conversion efficiency of the rectenna will also be very low. By optimizing not only the subsystems of a rectenna but also taking the propagation channel into account and using the channel information for adapting the transmit antenna radiation pattern, the RF energy transport efficiency will be improved. The rectenna optimization, channel modeling and design of a transmit antenna are discussed.

AB  - Infrared thermography has proved to be an adequate technique for building inspection, as it can be used to determine energy efficiency and also to detect defects in construction. Geometry and spatial relationships are also very important in building inspection because they make location of thermal defects and measurement of affected surfaces possible. A procedure to fuse automatically generated infrared mosaics and visible images to combine geometric information with thermal data in the same image is described in this paper. Fused images are then used for the automatic generation of a thermographic 3D model of the building through image matching, where apart from having thermographic information available, geometric measurements can be performed. The proposed methodology is suitable for building inspection, where working space and time are usually limited so a reduction on the number and size of instruments is appreciated. Furthermore, automation of the process diminishes the error in results by avoiding operator's influence. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Leveraging the emerging technologies of Energy Informatics and cross-reality, a new concept is proposed for how buildings and their systems are designed and operated. The basic premise of Energy Informatics contends that information has the power to reduce energy consumption, which, in a simple fashion, is asserted as "Energy + Information = Less Energy". The concept of informatics can be applied to energy issues in the built environment from scales ranging from individual pieces of equipment (such as with fault detection and diagnostics) up to regional or country level (such as with a smart electrical grid). Facilities Management and Modeling (FMM) is introduced as a new form of information systems to apply the principles of Energy Informatics to increasing energy efficiency in building operations. There are three core principles that guide the design of FMM: measurement, modeling, and management. The characteristics and use of FMM are discussed. Also introduced are potential applications for how cross-realty concepts can be applied in the training of students and professionals in the operation of complex building systems. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - As energy costs continue to rise, businesses need smarter energy management strategies. This paper starts with several definitions, then it discusses a method to help define a smart energy efficiency strategy in existing buildings by IT systems without realizing civil works. This method aims to develop an efficient and user-friendly Facility Management process based on Building Information Modelling and Interoperability. The case study is the Politecnico di Torino campus and the objective is to obtain a theoretical model that can be applied to wide typologies of existing buildings in Europe. In the first stage of the current research, software tools were tested and the results are shown to lead to an accurate definition of a digital model of buildings, lighting and HVAC systems that can be used in Facility Management. Preliminary results indicate that there is a possibility of obtaining smart solutions if a holistic approach is clearly defined.

The methodology described in this paper is largely based on information that is already available on building stock (i.e., cartographic documentation, thematic maps, geometric data and others). Data regarding the energy performance of buildings are collected using energy audits on sample buildings, which are selected using a statistical approach. Using the tools in a GIS platform, the integration of two data sources allows for a low cost, comprehensive framework of the energy performance of buildings. This methodology was tested in a medium sized town in the Lombardy region (Italy), and the results are discussed in this paper. © 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - With the ever increasing device count and the introduction of pervasive computing in residential homes, naturally also the energy demand constantly rises. Currently, much effort is put in counteracting this development by making appliances more energy efficient. However, a still widely neglected potential for energy savings resides in the use, control and interaction of facilities. To reach their full efficiency during operation, a comprehensive software system that orchestrates all energy facilities in the home is needed. Such a solution also provides an integration point for decentralized energy production systems and smart grid applications. To operate successfully, the system has to be aware of a multitude of different energy parameters and facilities as well as providers in order to make energy efficient decisions on behalf of the user, thus aiding in the realization of an eco-friendly operation of the smart home. In this work, such a smart home knowledge base is realized following the Web Ontology Language (OWL) standard. Its structure makes all knowledge easily available to the smart home system and considerably supports the control processes with its inherent logic. © 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The exposure and diffusion of energy consumption information in building occupant peer networks has been shown to influence an individual's energy consumption decisions. In this paper, we develop an agent-based computational model for individual energy consumption behavior based on data collected during an experiment on residential energy use. We simulate the building occupants' decision making and the information transmission process. By comparing the impact of several parameters in the network level computational model and validating the parameters in a second experimental setting, our research serves to clarify how network relations can be leveraged for modifying energy consumption behavior. Network degree and weight were identified as the major structural parameters that impact building occupants' conservation decisions, while network size was found to have no significant impact. These findings have important implications for the design and effectiveness of residential energy feedback systems designed to promote energy conservation in residential buildings. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Carbon emissions associated with new buildings are being reduced by the increasing stringency of building regulations [1]. It is however, the retrofitting of existing buildings for minimum carbon emissions throughout their expected lifetime that poses the biggest challenge at this time. This paper considers the assessment of retrofitting non-domestic buildings using two different modelling techniques, Static Simulation Modelling and Dynamic Simulation Modelling. A case-study building, located on the campus of University College Cork, was used for the modelling and actual retrofit. This allowed for a comparison to be made between actual measured data and the proposed modelling techniques with regard to thermal energy modelling. The measured data along with the two types of modelled data, gave an extensive data set from which the assessment of the two modelling techniques could be made. This assessment proposes a modelling technique which is sufficient to base future retrofitting decisions upon. This research demonstrates clearly that fundamental building information, simplified occupancy profiles, simplified weather data and a less time consuming model is a sufficient and adequate means to base retrofitting decisions on. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Currently, Building Information Modeling (BIM) has been recognized as one of the main processes and technologies that can enhance design and construction quality by simulating and optimizing business works for better performance, lower costs, and shorter lead times. Accordingly, BIM has emerged as one of the main issues of environmentally friendly and energy-efficient design in the field of architecture. In particular, several researches on BIM-based energy performance assessments have been carried out focusing on the early design phase. However, energy performance assessment tools have a fundamental problem concerning data interoperability among them owing to the lack of a standardized data format and access method. To address such issues, an Industry Foundation Classes (IFC)-based Input Data File (IDF) converter was developed in this research to use as a middleware to minimize the loss of information and generate additional information during the performance analysis process. This paper introduces the IDF converter supporting energy performance assessments, integrated material library, etc. and demonstrates the efficiency of its use in a case study.

AB  - Te level of man-made CO2 emissions worldwide climbed to a new record of 30 billion tons in 2010. In 2011, at the COP17 U.N. Climate Change Conference in Durban, South Africa, high-ranking representatives from around the world met again to discuss solutions. For the building sector, numerous energy-efficiency market changes and benchmarking resolutions, like the mandatory E.U. "nearly Net-Zero-Energy-Building (NET-ZEB's) 2018 and 2020 regulations" for all new public and privately owned buildings are now set up to help minimizing carbon emissions and reverse the negative impact.1 In the United States, the American Institute of Architects (AIA) adopted the 2030 Challenge as a voluntary program, where participating buildings aim to achieve a 90% fossil fuel reduction by 2025, and carbon-neutrality by 2030.2 To accomplish these energy goals, designers must strive to best design and utilize the resources available on a site. However, are these goals of achieving carbon-neutral buildings possible? How can NET-ZEB's become the curricular standard and practical routine in education and the profession? To date, the basic curricular design process components with integrated project delivery metrics for a robust 3-D/4-D-net-zero regulatory design framework are either incomplete or missing, However, formally-based curriculums have begun to weave carbon-neutral design tools into their pedagogy. This research paper critically compares how these new criteria for digital 3-D-building information modeling (BIM), and "Integrated Project Delivery" are mandating a better integration of collaborative carbon-neutral designs into the curriculum and practice of the profession. The majority of those in architectural academia have been using generative computation primarily for pure, aesthetic form-finding, without applying zero-carbon-energy-driven global performance metrics and CO2e reduction strategies to reiterate derived carbon-neutral designs. Te advantage of 3-D-parametric design is that it links variables, dimensions, and materials to geometry in a way that when an input or simulation value changes, the 3-D/4-D model automatically updates all life-cycle scenarios and components simultaneously.

AB  - Due to the need for improving the energy efficiency of existing buildings, various methods for energy retrofitting are being developed. One such initiative is the TES Energy Façade project, a joint European academia and industry project under the umbrella of the WoodWisdom Net research platform. The project has developed a systematic approach for using prefabricated timber-framed elements that can be assembled in front of an existing façade. The TES approach requires a detailed and precise documentation of the as-built/as-maintained conditions of the existing façade. This paper discusses the approach for the surveying and documentation of a building's existing state and the need to establish a continuous digital chain that encompasses the various project stages from the survey to the site assembly of the elements.

AB  - A streamlined and cost-effective energy modeling process should provide building owners with accurate and timely information at a reasonable cost to allow them to make informed decisions about implementing energy efficiency improvements. The process includes calibrating a whole building annual energy model to monthly utility bills with no sub-metered energy use or hourly trend data available. The calibration target for the energy model from NREL was to achieve within 10% of annual building energy cost. This is a fairly course calibration target, with thousands of different combinations of model inputs as possible solutions. Researchers used experience, observation, and existing research to determine which inputs to vary for calibration while trying not to spend time on details that would not impact results. Another simplification was in using a TMY weather file during calibration instead of actual weather data.

AB  - Buildings and other engineered structures that form cities are responsible for a significant portion of the global and local impacts of climate change. Consequently, the installation of building integrated renewable energy sources such as photovoltaic or solar thermal systems on building rooftops is being widely investigated. Although the advantages for individual buildings have been studied, as yet there is little understanding of the potential benefits of urban scale implementation of such systems. Here we report the development of a new methodology for assessing the potential capacity and benefits of installing rooftop photovoltaic systems in an urbanized area. Object oriented image analysis and geographical information systems are combined with remote sensing image data to quantify the rooftop area available for solar energy applications and a renewable energy computer simulation is included to predict the potential benefits of urban scale photovoltaic system implementation. The new methodology predicts energy generation potential that can be utilized to meet Arizona's Renewable Portfolio Standard 2025 renewable energy generation requirements. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The role of Commercial Building Energy Consumption Survey (CBECS) in the field of building performance evaluation is presented. CBECS is part of the Energy Information Administration (EIA) which is under the DOE. The Commercial Buildings Energy Consumption Survey is a national sample survey that collects information on the stock of the US commercial buildings, their energy-related building characteristics, and their energy consumption and expenditures. CBECS is currently conducted on a quadrennial basis. The information from CBECS is the basis for many federal and private sector energy efficiency and sustainability programs, including the Energy Star Buildings program, Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) for Existing Buildings, and other building energy labeling platforms. The CBECS is also used to check computer modeling programs against real world data.

AB  - Atria are becoming an increasingly common feature of new buildings. They are often included for their aesthetic appeal; however, their effect on building indoor environment can be significant. Building simulation tools have the potential to assist designers in enhancing energy efficiency by providing information on the temperature and velocity fields inside the atrium for specified geometries and ambient conditions. The unique nature of the physical phenomena that govern the complex flows in atria, however, are not usually considered in traditional building energy simulation programs. These physical phenomena include turbulent natural convection, radiative heat transfer and conjugate heat transfer. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) has the potential for modeling fluid flow and heat transfer resulting from the phenomena; however, careful validation is required in order to establish the accuracy of predictions. This paper provides a systematic validation of a commercial CFD code against experimental measurements of the underlying physical phenomena. The validation culminates in the simulation of an existing atrium. This work indicates that CFD can be used to successfully simulate the heat transfer and fluid flow in atria geometries and provides recommendations regarding turbulence and radiative heat transfer modeling. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The paper investigates a single-sided naturally ventilated buildings potential model considering number of factors in China. This model can be used to estimate potential of natural ventilation via local climate data and building parameters. The main goal of the model is to predict natural ventilation hours and hourly ventilation flow rate. In fluid model, formula of single-sided natural ventilation by coupling wind pressure and temperature difference was used to calculate air flow rate. Accordingly, the paper analyzed four typical cities in different climate region in China and calculated pressure difference Pascal hours (PDPH). The results show that single-sided ventilation has fewer adaptive comfort hours than two-sided ventilation and much less ventilation volume. This model provided quantitative information for early stage architectural natural ventilation design and building energy efficiency evaluation. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AU  - Bagula, A.B.
AB  - This paper revisits the problem of Quality of Service (QoS) provisioning to assess the relevance of using multipath routing to improve the reliability and packet delivery in wireless sensor networks while maintaining lower power consumption levels. Building upon a previous benchmark, we propose a traffic engineering model that relies on delay, reliability, and energy-constrained paths to achieve faster, reliable, and energy-efficient transmission of the information routed by a wireless sensor network. As a step forward into the implementation of the proposed QoS model, we describe the initial steps of its packet forwarding protocol and highlight the tradeoff between the complexity of the model and the ease of implementation. Using simulation, we demonstrate the relative efficiency of our proposed model compared to single path routing, disjoint path routing, and the previously proposed benchmarks. The results reveal that by achieving a good tradeoff between delay minimization, reliability maximization, and path set selection, our model outperforms the other models in terms of energy consumption and quality of paths used to route the information. © 2010 Antoine B.

AB  - The paper brings about a two-opening naturally ventilated building potential model considering solution multiplicity, window opening percentage, air velocity and humidity in China. Based on previous research by Yang et al. and Luo et al., this paper developed a revised model to estimate the natural ventilation potential. There are four main improvements: Firstly, counteract of wind and thermal pressure was included and method for multiple solutions was introduced accordingly. Secondly, the model considered the natural ventilation hours for windows opening percentage. Thirdly, wind velocity and humidity were considered lastly. Fourthly, cooling and heating hours were also estimated. In case study, the paper analyzes natural ventilation potential in cities in four typical climate regions in China. Results show that there are more natural ventilation hours than previous models estimated, especially in cold climate regions. Any parameter in this model can be changed according to practical situation, such as climate data, building orientation, window size, opening position, etc. All estimated information can provide reference for architects in early stages of building design. Meanwhile, this model can be used for energy efficiency estimation and indoor environment research. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Utilizing the concepts of sustainability in urban community design, the elements of the physical spatial design – such as building stock lay–out, building form including envelope design, and landscape design – are strongly considered to integrate with the issues of the urban landscape view planning and the environmental planning – such as energy efficiency, sunshine access, CO2 emissions and absorptions, natural ventilation, and urban heat island phenomena. While high-rise apartment style has dominated most of urban community design as physical patterns of spatial design widely ranging from new towns to urban redevelopments in Korea, basic design evaluation tools hardly have been developed yet. Also, there is no specialized assessment system focused on urban community design. Therefore, the purpose of this research was to develop an integrated design evaluation tool focused on the basic design phase for urban community development, named ‘SUSB–UC for Basic Design’. It was a part of an integrated framework for whole urban community design and evaluation systems focused on the high-rise apartment style housing. The main purpose of this research was considerations of the relationship between indicators concerning the urban landscape view planning, physical spatial design and the performance by environmental planning based on the BIM technology. © 2010 The International Institute for Strategic Studies.

TI  - Moving towards low-carbon buildings and cities: Experiences from Oxford, UK
PY  - 2009
AU  - Gupta, R.
AB  - This paper reviews two key initiatives undertaken in the historical city of Oxford to bring about reductions in energy-related CO2 emissions on a dwelling-level as well as city-wide scale, using both bottom-up and top-down carbon-counting approaches. The development and application of a bottom-up carbon-counting approach called DECoRuM is described. DECoRuM is a Geographical Information System-based software model which estimates and maps baseline energy use and CO2 emissions on a house-by-house level, identifies 'pollution' hotspots, predicts the potential for reductions in CO2 emissions and monitors reductions achieved as a result of deploying energy efficiency measures and renewable energy systems. The application of DECoRuM model to a case study in Oxford shows that CO2 emission reductions above 60% are possible, at a cost of between £6 and £77 per tonne of CO2 emissions saved, depending upon the package of measures used and the scenario of capital costs (low or high) employed. Alongside DECoRuM, the author has led the development of an action-oriented Oxford Climate Change Action Plan (OCCAP) which uses top-down approaches to construct an accurate CO2 emissions inventory for Oxford city for a baseline year, establish CO2 reduction targets and propose action for each of the energy-related sectors to meet those targets. These two different, but complimentary, approaches provide a useful example for other cities in their endeavour for emission reductions. © The Author 2009. Published by Oxford University Press.

Many designers point out that in most cases, there is a return on the investment in building green. Increase in energy prices along with a greater interest in energy independence and alternative energy, has caused owners to take a new look at sustainable design in planning their projects. One developing area of sustainable design that is gaining traction is energy use feedback. There is a growing interest in net-zero buildings, where the facilities are effectively energy self-sufficient. The move toward a more integrated design approach for sustainability has been given a significant boost from building information modeling (BIM).

AB  - Low energy dynamic compaction has been developed as an efficient and rapid method of improving properties of foundation soils unsuitable for moderate building loads. A series of low energy dynamic compaction tests was undertaken on rigorously controlled model beds of sand at 1:20th scale in a 500 g tonne centrifuge at 20 g to prove the system and to validate an innovative real-time soil stiffness monitoring approach. The results of seven centrifuge tests are presented to demonstrate the effect of the impact on the performance of the sand bed with increasing number of blows. Attenuation monitored by the dynamic load cells and embedded accelerometers showed improvement of soil mechanical behaviour. The rate and efficiency of improvement was clearly demonstrated by the relationship of peak particle velocity and dynamic peak pressure with increasing number of blows. The soil response was monitored by real time signal processing and analysis using the WAK (Wave Activated Stiffness (K)) analysis which has been proved to be a very reliable indicator of process success. © 2009 Asian Network for Scientific Information.

AB  - This paper gives a detailed technical overview of some of the activities carried out in the context of the "Wireless Sensor networks for city-Wide Ambient Intelligence (WISE-WAI)" project, funded by the Cassa di Risparmio di Padova e Rovigo Foundation, Italy. The main aim of the project is to demonstrate the feasibility of large-scale wireless sensor network deployments, whereby tiny objects integrating one or more environmental sensors (humidity, temperature, light intensity), a microcontroller and a wireless transceiver are deployed over a large area, which in this case involves the buildings of the Department of Information Engineering at the University of Padova. We will describe how the network is organized to provide full-scale automated functions, and which services and applications it is configured to provide. These applications include long-term environmental monitoring, alarm event detection and propagation, single-sensor interrogation, localization and tracking of objects, assisted navigation, as well as fast data dissemination services to be used, e.g., to rapidly re-program all sensors over-the-air. The organization of such a large testbed requires notable efforts in terms of communication protocols and strategies, whose design must pursue scalability, energy efficiency (while sensors are connected through USB cables for logging and debugging purposes, most of them will be battery-operated), as well as the capability to support applications with diverse requirements. These efforts, the description of a subset of the results obtained so far, and of the final objectives to be met are the scope of the present paper. © 2009 by the authors; licensee Molecular Diversity Preservation International, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Increasing the use of electricity and the need for more and safer power generation has motivated investigation into new control methods resulting in better performance. Better system performance means increase in power generation efficiency, also decrease in the maintenance costs. To design suitable controllers, adequate information about the system dynamics is required, which in turn has motivated the methods of system identification and simulation studies of power plants. In this paper, simple first-order models are developed for the subsystems of a subcritical once-through boiler, based on the principles of thermodynamics and energy-mass balance, together with parameter estimation routines. These routines are applied on the experimental data obtained from a complete set of field experiments. However, since most processes in a boiler are categorized as multi-input and multi-output systems, mathematical boiler models, which are derived from physical structure and parameters estimation routines, lead to a time-consuming procedure, and employing such models in control algorithms becomes very complex. Therefore, to improve the dynamics modelling, a concise multilayer neuro fuzzy model of the boiler is developed. Next, these two models are compared based on the performance of the real system. This comparison validates the accuracy of both original and neuro fuzzy models, while the latter can be successfully employed in simulation studies, and to design modern model-based control systems. Finally, a new Fuzzy P2 ID controller is developed to use for superheaters temperature control. Simulation results show very good performance of this controller in terms of more accurate and less fluctuation in the temperature of corresponding subsystems, compared to the existing classic controllers.

AB  - Energy-efficient design for buildings (EEDB) is a vital step towards building energy-saving. In order to greatly improve the EEDB, the next generation EEDB software that makes use of latest technologies needs to be developed. This paper mainly focuses on establishing the model of the next generation EEDB software. Based on the investigation of literatures and the interviews to the designers, the requirements on the next generation EEDB software were identified, where the lifecycle assessment on both energy consumption and environmental impacts, 3D graphics support, and building information modeling (BIM) support were stressed. Then the workflow for using the next generation EEDB software was established. Finally, based on the workflow, the framework model for the software was proposed, and the partial models and the corresponding functions were systematically analyzed. The model lays a solid foundation for developing the next generation EEDB software. © 2008 Tsinghua University Press.

TI  - The reality and future scenarios of commercial building energy consumption in China
PY  - 2008
AU  - Zhou, N.
AU  - Lin, J.
AB  - While China's 11th Five-Year Plan called for a reduction of energy intensity by 2010, whether and how the energy consumption trend can be changed in a short time has been hotly debated. This research intends to evaluate the impact of a variety of scenarios of gross domestic product (GDP) growth, energy elasticity and energy-efficiency improvement on energy consumption in commercial buildings in China using a detailed China End-Use Energy Model. China's official energy statistics have limited information on energy demand by end-use. This is a particularly pertinent issue for building energy consumption. The authors have applied reasoned judgments, based on experience of working on Chinese efficiency standards and energy-related programs, to present a realistic interpretation of the current energy data. The bottom-up approach allows detailed consideration of end-use intensity, equipment efficiency, etc., thus facilitating assessment of potential impacts of specific policy and technology changes on building energy use. The results suggest that: (1) commercial energy consumption in China's current statistics is underestimated by about 44%, and the fuel mix is misleading; (2) energy-efficiency improvements will not be sufficient to offset the strong increase in end-use penetration and intensity in commercial buildings; (3) energy intensity (particularly electricity) in commercial buildings will increase; (4) different GDP growth and elasticity scenarios could lead to a wide range of floor area growth trajectories, and therefore, significantly impact energy consumption in commercial buildings. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Energy simulation models are developed with EnergyPlus for two office buildings in a R&D center in Shanghai, China to evaluate the energy cost savings of green building design options compared with the baseline building. As a R&D center of an international IT corporation, there are data centers in the two buildings, which make them different from typical office buildings. The data centers house high energy consuming IT equipments and need 24 h air-conditioning every day all year round. In order to achieve energy cost savings, multiple energy efficiency strategies are employed for design proposed building, encompassing high performance building envelope, lighting system, and HVAC system. Through energy modeling, the design proposed options are compared to an ASHRAE 90.1-2004 compliant budget model to highlight energy cost savings versus "standard practice" and show the potential LEED™ Credit EA1-Optimize Energy Performance. Meanwhile, they are also compared to China Code model to figure out the energy cost savings versus the most popular practice conforming to China Public Building Energy Saving Design Standard. The whole building energy simulation results show that the yearly energy cost saving of the proposed design will be approximately 27% from China Code building and 21% from ASHRAE budget building, which can achieve 4 points for LEED credit due to energy performance optimization. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The recent development of Google Earth, an information service that provides imagery and three-dimensional data depicting the entire Earth, provides an opportunity to use a new method of navigating information to save energy in the real world. Google Earth uses Keyhole Markup Language (KML) for modeling and storing geographic features and information for display in the Google Earth Client. This paper will analyze the potential of this novel and free geographic mapping service to reduce embodied energy of transportation in two ways. First, at the consumer level, Google Earth will be studied to map the automobile route that uses the least fuel and maintains vehicle velocities at their individual maximum fuel efficiency. The same analysis for single destination trips could be used to optimize fleet vehicle routes such as garbage or recycling collection trucks. The secondary benefit of ecological education will also be explored. Fuel used could be converted into monetary units based on the current price of gas, pollution/greenhouse gas emissions, or ecological footprints to improve driving habits. Secondly, KML overlays will be analyzed for use of determining: (i) raw material and products availability as a function of location, and (ii) modes of transportation as a function of emissions. These overlays would enable manufacturers access to an easily navigable method to optimize the life cycle of their products by minimizing embodied energy of transportation. The most efficient transportation methods and travel routes could be calculated. This same tool would be useful for architects to obtain Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design rating points for the green design of buildings. Overall, the analysis completed finds that the flexibility and visual display of quantitative information made available by Google Earth could have a significant impact at conserving fuel resources by reducing the embodied energy of transportation on a global scale. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

AU  - Gore, S.P.
AU  - Karmali, A.M.
AU  - Blundell, T.L.
AB  - Background. Macromolecular structures are modeled by conformational optimization within experimental and knowledge-based restraints. Discrete restraint-based sampling generates high-quality structures within these restraints and facilitates further refinement in a continuous all-atom energy landscape. This approach has been used successfully for protein loop modeling, comparative modeling and electron density fitting in X-ray crystallography. Results. Here we present a software toolkit (Rappertk) which generalizes discrete restraint-based sampling for use in structural biology. Modular design and multi-layered architecture enables Rappertk to sample conformations of any macromolecule at many levels of detail and within a variety of experimental restraints. Performance against a Cα-tracing benchmark shows that the efficiency has not suffered despite the overhead required by this flexibility. We demonstrate the toolkit's capabilities by building high-quality β-sheets and by introducing restraint-driven sampling. RNA sampling is demonstrated by rebuilding a protein-RNA interface. Ability to construct arbitrary ligands is used in sampling protein-ligand interfaces within electron density. Finally, secondary structure and shape information derived from EM are combined to generate multiple conformations of a protein consistent with the observed density. Conclusion. Through its modular design and ease of use, Rappertk enables exploration of a wide variety of interesting avenues in structural biology.

AU  - Turner, C.
AB  - The modeling and performance of the US Green Building Council Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) using basic whole-building information, is discussed. The estimated energy savings were calculated by two ways: the first method includes comparison of actual energy use with baseline modeling measured by LEED submittal, providing a savings estimate relative to a comparable new building without efficiency measures. This method can reflect the climate, structure, and general system characteristics of actual buildings. Second method includes actual energy use per square foot was compared with the commercial-building average for the region and then the savings from the perspective of the various buildings were estimated. The saving related to the indoor-water modeling helps in the development of industry benchmark figures for water usage and in estimating future calculations of the indoor-water savings.

AB  - In light of the current situation of energy efficiency building design in China and the situation of energy analysis tools application both at home and abroad, aiming at the fact that traditional energy efficiency building design methods cannot meet current needs, this paper puts forward a new design approach - integrating BIM technology with energy efficiency analysis to carry out energy efficiency building design. The virtual building model created with BIM technology is an electronic database containing all of the building's information. By importing this virtual building model into energy analysis tools, we can automatically identify and analyze a great amount of information in the models so as to quickly and easily get the energy efficiency analysis results.

AB  - The concept of building information modeling (BIM) necessary for the design of green building can provide the characteristics and performance of design concepts. It allows the architects/engineers (A/E) to compare sustainable alternatives to balance energy and resource efficiency with project costs. Designers gain the analytical skills necessary to work green and these approaches will be integrated into their standard services. Life-cycle cost analysis (LCA) reflects the savings and benefits of sustainable design. BIM provides a parametric database of the digital representation of a building that reflects the project scope, schedule, and cost information throughout the development process. BIM is characterized by the continuous and immediate availability of internally consistent and reliable information abort the projects. BIM integrate building models with energy analysis tools for routine evaluation geometrically correct thermal models.

AB  - The application of bioclimatic principles is a critical factor in reducing energy consumption and CO2 emissions of the building sector. This paper develops a regression model of energy efficiency as a function of environmental conditions, building characteristics and passive solar technologies. A sample of 77 bioclimatic buildings (including 45 houses) was collected, covering Greece, other Mediterranean areas and the rest of Europe. Average energy efficiency varied from 19.6 to 100% with an average of about 68%. Environmental conditions included latitude, altitude, ambient temperature, degree days and sun hours; building characteristics consisted in building area and volume. Passive solar technologies included (among others) solar water heaters, shading, natural ventilation, greenhouses and thermal storage walls. Degree days and a dummy variable indicating location in the Mediterranean area were the strongest predictors of energy efficiency while taller and leaner buildings tended to be more energy efficient. Surprisingly, many passive technologies did not appear to make a difference on energy efficiency while thermal storage walls in fact seemed to decrease energy efficiency. The model developed may be of use to architects, engineers and policy makers. Suggestions for further research include obtaining more building information, investigating the effect of passive solar technologies and gathering information on the usage of building. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Solar irradiance data on various inclined surfaces at different orientations are important information for active solar-system analyses and passive energy-efficient building designs. In many parts of the world, however, the basic solar irradiance data for the surfaces of interest are not always readily available. Traditionally, different mathematical models have been developed to predict the solar irradiance on various inclined surfaces using "horizontal" data. Alternatively, the diffuse irradiance of a sloping plane can be calculated by integrating the radiance distribution generated with a sky radiance model. This paper presents the evaluation of two slope irradiance models, namely, the Perez point-source model (PEREZSIM) and the Muneer model (MUNEERSIM), and two sky-distribution models, namely, the Perez all-weather model (PEREZSDM) and the Kittler standard-sky model (KITTLERSDM). Three-year (1999-2001) measured average hourly sky radiance and horizontal sky diffuse irradiance data were used for the model assessment. Statistical results showed that all four models can accurately predict the solar irradiance of a 22.3° (latitude angle of Hong Kong) inclined south-oriented surface, indicating the good predictive ability for modelling an inclined surface with a small tilted angle. In general, the KITTLERSDM and PEREZSIM show the best predictions for vertical solar irradiance at this location, followed by the PEREZSDM, then the MUNEERSIM. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The need to reduce pollutant emissions and utilise the world's available energy resources more efficiently has led to increased attention towards e.g. fuel cells, but also to other alternative energy solutions. In order to further understand and evaluate the prerequisites for sustainable and energy-saving systems, ABB and Fortum have equipped an environmental information centre, located in Hammarby Sjöstad, Stockholm, Sweden, with an alternative energy system. The system is being used to demonstrate and evaluate how a system based on fuel cells and solar cells can function as a complement to existing electricity and heat production. The stationary energy system is situated on the top level of a three-floor glass building and is open to the public. The alternative energy system consists of a fuel cell system, a photovoltaic (PV) cell array, an electrolyser, hydrogen storage tanks, a biogas burner, dc/ac inverters, heat exchangers and an accumulator tank. The fuel cell system includes a reformer and a polymer electrolyte fuel cell (PEFC) with a maximum rated electrical output of 4 kWel and a maximum thermal output of 6.5 kWth. The fuel cell stack can be operated with reformed biogas, or directly using hydrogen produced by the electrolyser. The cell stack in the electrolyser consists of proton exchange membrane (PEM) cells. To evaluate different automatic control strategies for the system, a simplified dynamic model has been developed in MATLAB Simulink. The model based on measurement data taken from the actual system. The evaluation is based on demand curves, investment costs, electricity prices and irradiation. Evaluation criteria included in the model are electrical and total efficiencies as well as economic parameters. © 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - In order to encourage the use of computer modelling in building environmental analysis, it is necessary to provide a model developed from the designer's point of view. Detailed simulation models require a high degree of expertise and familiarity, further, there is also a need for detailed information not available in the early stages of the design process. Simplified models play an important role in the early stages of a design to achieve an integrated design: firstly, they are easy to use and, secondly, they require information easily available at the start of a design. In the Early Design Model (EDM) the solar gain utilisation factor has been determined as a continuous function of thermal mass. The differences between the annual energy predictions of EDM and SERI-RES ranges from 0.1% to 4.6% for time constants ranging from 378 to 2.52 hours. The differences between the two sets of predictions on monthly basis ranges from -3.6% to -6.48% (EDM's predictions being larger) during the heating season, and from +2.86% to a maximum of +51% (EDM's predictions being smaller) in the remaining part of the year. In addition to energy predictions, EDM incorporates a facility which gives cost indications.

TI  - A neuro-mechanical model of legged locomotion: Single leg control
PY  - 1998
AU  - Wadden, T.
AU  - Ekeberg, Ö.
AB  - Most models of legged locomotion have concentrated on properties of either the mechanical or the neural system. Here a combined neuro-mechanical model of stepping in a single leg is presented, as the first step in the process of modeling and building a fast and dynamically stable quadruped. It is based on general principles of legged animals with special reference to vertebrates. The mechanical leg was first studied separately in order to take advantage of its inherent mechanical properties and avoid over-control during stepping generation. As a part of the design strategy it uses elastic actuators to increase shock tolerance and energy efficiency. The neural controller consists of a neural phase generator (NPG), a system of fast feedback pathways, and a single control neuron representing descending drive from higher centers in the brain. Sensory information directly influences the movements through the fast feedback pathways, but also entrains the NPG. The NPG has its own description of the state of the leg, which then enables it to set the feedback pathways so that only actions appropriate for the particular stage of the step cycle are undertaken. This preprogramming benefits from the NPG's ability to filter out any inconsistencies or gaps in the afferent input. In this way the model unites the use of central pattern generators and peripheral feedback systems for the generation of stepping movements. The neuro-mechanical system produced stable stepping patterns over a large velocity range and was adaptable to different body weights and landing from varying heights.

AB  - A companion paper discusses various issues involved in baselining energy use at either the whole facility level or at the building level when monthly utility bills are available. It describes the variable-base degree-day (VBDD) and the monthly mean temperature (MMT) regression modeling approaches for normalizing energy use for changes in outdoor temperature from the baseline year to subsequent years, and it proposes statistical equations to determine prediction uncertainty for individual monthly and annual time intervals for change-point energy models whose residual variance is not constant. The objectives of this paper are to apply these concepts to monthly utility electricity and gas use data from eight Army installations nationwide, to evaluate the VBDD and the MMT approaches, and to discuss salient results of the analysis. Finally, we illustrate the use of a statistical method suggested in the companion paper whereby approximate read dates of the utility billing period can be identified in cases where such information is lacking.

AU  - Kennington, J.
AU  - Monaghan, P.F.
AB  - Integrated intelligent building design systems (IIBDSs) are computer-based design environments which will in the future be used by engineers and architects to assist them in the design of buildings. This paper deals with the class of IIBDSs whose aim it is to improve the energy efficiency and overall performance of buildings. Development of these IIBDSs is a substantial task and may take some time to be realized. The EC COMBINE project and the U.S. AEDOT project have been initiated to take the first step towards developing these future IIBDSs. This paper focuses on the COMBINE project. COMBINE's first step towards developing IIBDSs is to implement a building product model based on the 'product modelling' approach promoted by the computer-integrated manufacturing (CIM) community. This building product model allows information about a building to be passed between different design professionals (e.g. architects, heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning (HVAC) system designers etc.). Data exchange through the product model is tested using various design prototypes one of which is called the HVAC-Design prototype. The HVAC-Design prototype helps a HVAC system designer to select a preliminary HVAC system for a building. This paper reviews: (a) ongoing research into the development of IIBDSs and (b) various software tools which may be incorporated into future IIBDSs. The main emphasis of the paper is on the COMBINE project and the functionality of the HVAC-Design prototype in COMBINE. There is also a discussion on how HVAC-Design may develop in the future. © 1993.

AB  - In spite of high potential for saving energy in US buildings, adoption rates for residential conservation technologies have been low. Research in the social and behavioural sciences helps to explain these low adoption rates and suggests strategies for improving conservation delivery systems. The authors propose a social diffusion model as a useful conceptual framework for analysing the spread of conservation devices. This formulation stresses the importance of existing social networks, focusing on the transmission of vivid and personal information from credible sources and the modelling of the behaviour of trusted others. A review is presented of successful utility, government and community conservation programmes that address the complexities of human information processing and make special efforts to overcome structural barriers to participation by all energy consumers. Exemplary programmes are identified and a checklist is provided for use in conservation programme planning, implementation and evaluation. © 1986.
